3584,Return on Investment (ROI),"if i were to invest the 60,000 when do you think yeah eventually i would get my money back",,
3585,Return on Investment (ROI),what are you expecting to getback in five years time,,
3586,Return on Investment (ROI),guys what are you expecting to get back in 5 years time,,
3588,Return on Investment (ROI),but uh what's the earning capacity of investment into a pole dancing studio,,
3589,Return on Investment (ROI),are you thinking through my offer it costs you a lot less if you're actually going to be successful?,,
3590,Return on Investment (ROI),i'm curious as how would the investor would get 300 000 back if you're talking about a couple of thousand dollars in net revenue per sale you know the retrofit i think could eat that if you're not careful i wish i could help you more but i'm i'm out thank you very much thank you,,
3594,Return on Investment (ROI),would i get my money back,,
3596,Return on Investment (ROI),what's our likely firstyear second year and third year returnbased on your experience of the sharknado franchise?,,
3597,Return on Investment (ROI),how do you see us getting our money back i'm a little worried that we're going to continue to take what profits we do have and roll them back into growth on an ongoing basis how do we eventually get the 200 000 and more back,,
3599,Return on Investment (ROI),if i go in at 130k for 10 share what is it going to be worth in five years if we follow your roadmap,,
3600,Return on Investment (ROI),"$250,000 is a lot ofmoneyy so let me let me just explain to you what $250,000 means if you think of your what we would call your profit on this item yeah you'd be lucky to get a return of 50 per unit to your shareholder it's probably more likely to be 10cents so how many do you need to sell at 10 cents profit to return the $250,000 to the investor",,
3602,Return on Investment (ROI),so if i invest 170 000 i will get 20 of an hundred thousand dollar profit by year two,,
3603,Return on Investment (ROI),guess you got opening day what's our likely first year second year and third year return based on your experience of the sharknado franchise if we rent it so it's built it's ready to go you can have it in may two rentals you've got the money back?,,
3604,Return on Investment (ROI),how fast will it will it take me to get that?,,
3605,Return on Investment (ROI),so for you to break even you said give me 800 000 i'll give you back 1.3 million over what period of time,,
3607,Return on Investment (ROI),how do you grow a business and and at that valuation so you're not actually addressing the answers of from an investor's point of view we bought that there's a viable business there we bought the need and we bought the fact that employers need to do more of this what we're really challenged by is your valuation of 2.5 million and can you execute to give us a return on our investment,,
3608,Return on Investment (ROI),so i'm trying to figure out how i get my money back so if i put 75k in you've not made 75k ever,,
3610,Return on Investment (ROI),would would you consider after you get your investment back sliding the scale slightlydown?,,
3611,Return on Investment (ROI),and what is your payback period on a location,,
3612,Return on Investment (ROI),even if you end up hitting your million and your 1.6 which is a massive challenge that still would mean even if i had 20 25 of the business i'm kind of bordering on just getting my money back over three years and that's the risk factor,,
3613,Return on Investment (ROI),the problem is the return that i would get we take far too long,,
3616,Return on Investment (ROI),so if you were to get the sixty thousand when would i get it back do you think,,
3624,Return on Investment (ROI),can we have any uh share back if we haveanyparticularly good performance then from that point,,
3625,Return on Investment (ROI),so you're saying if you do three millionyep you get ten back if we can make the business what we think it should be and one point two in profityeah,,
3629,Return on Investment (ROI),"i give you the $500,000, how do i get my money back?",,
3630,Return on Investment (ROI),i give you 150 000 how do i get it back?,,
3633,Return on Investment (ROI),"i'm trying to figure out, like, how long will it take for me to see my money back?",,
3638,Return on Investment (ROI),"you've asked for investment of um well $40,000 but what is your vision and how are you going to return the investment to your partner?",,
3640,Return on Investment (ROI),uh i'm curious as how would the investor would get 300 000 back if you're talking about a couple of thousand dollars in net revenue per sale you know that the retro fit i think could eat that if you're not careful,,
3641,Return on Investment (ROI),"so you haven't taken it and gone to y mc donald's or someone else so you know you can push this button and see the latest promotion that's why i'm here i was thinking that's why you're here in putting in $50,000 what do you think the the return on that is going to be",,
3643,Return on Investment (ROI),what's the earning capacity of investment into a pole dancing studio?,,
3644,Return on Investment (ROI),where i have got aproblem isis that going to be enough interest forme to actually getinvolved with you and give you thethe knowledge my experience my contactsand everything else and work closelywith youthat's what i'm struggling with whathave you got to say about that,,
3645,Return on Investment (ROI),i'm willing to put in and i thinkyou know sometimes you make aninvestment because you see a tippingpoint my only point to you is there's atipping point and it's far awayit's going to take time to recoup this,,
3646,Return on Investment (ROI),how do i get it back,,
3648,Return on Investment (ROI),is a i toolkit a goodinvestment,,
3650,Return on Investment (ROI),how fast do you want your money back?,,
3651,Return on Investment (ROI),i mean if we did in 18 months would he be percentage de increase maybe there look if you gave me my money in 18 months i'd ruce it down to 20,,
3653,Return on Investment (ROI),as an investor how will i get my 178 000 back and plus my incredibly amazing return that you will deliver for me,,
3654,Return on Investment (ROI),"let me let me just explain toyou what$250,000means if you think of your what we wouldcall your profit on this y you'd belucky to get a return of 50 per unit toyourshareholder it's probably more likely tobe 10cents so how many do you need to sell at10 cents profit to return the$250,000 to theinvestor",,
3655,Return on Investment (ROI),70 000 how do you intend to pay that back or give the investor a return,,
3656,Return on Investment (ROI),what do you think's really important to me getting back,,
3657,Return on Investment (ROI),if you sell it for six hundred thousand punishable years timeyes the investor who's got twenty percent paid 150 for it will have twenty percent of six hundred thousand pounds which happens to come to a hundred and twenty thousand so that means we'll lose thirty thousand pounds,,
3658,Return on Investment (ROI),but in order for you to give the investor his money back in this we'd have to sell this company for 750 thousand pounds just to give the investor back his money and i don't think you're even gonna achieve that,,
3660,Return on Investment (ROI),and what sort of a return are youprojecting,,
3662,Return on Investment (ROI),how are you gonna turn this into a big return for you guys as the founders,,
3663,Return on Investment (ROI),is your expectation that that or thatroyalty is capped at a certain amount ofsales,,
3664,Return on Investment (ROI),so commercial terms of loan over two years three has to be two years look yeah the thing is if if we've got great growth i'm not going to be going right okay where's my return but there has to be some sort of like any business it has to have a capacity to be able to pay its line yes yes of course but i'm going to be a partner in the business 17,,
3665,Return on Investment (ROI),in terms of the offer to could do you want to consider my view on it's very simple if we got our money back i would drop to 10% and if they would agree to that then we'd have 20% at the end i'll agree to that,,
3666,Return on Investment (ROI),at what point do you think you're going to return the investment to the shark,,
3667,Return on Investment (ROI),guys what are you expecting to get back in five years time,,
3671,Return on Investment (ROI),give me your reason why i should partwith money from my 70-yard employees todo this,,
3672,Return on Investment (ROI),convince me that if i give you 200 000 i'm going to see any money back,,
3673,Return on Investment (ROI),how many hours are yougoing to fly a day how quickly do we geta return on the investment,,
3674,Return on Investment (ROI),you said the sharks that invest you want them to co-invest so not only do we put money into this deal but we have to put money into the first two or three property deals as well do we into the first few loans to get what returns will we get on those?,,
3675,Return on Investment (ROI),if i give you seven fifty thousand dollars and i'm an outside investor an investor i'm not an operator yep how do i get it back,,
3677,Return on Investment (ROI),so you you want us to build the business and then get our money back back i mean what's theincentive,,
3679,Return on Investment (ROI),how long do you think it's gonna take me to get my money back,,
3681,Return on Investment (ROI),how do i get my cashback,,
3682,Return on Investment (ROI),what does success look like for your investor today,,
3683,Return on Investment (ROI),how am i as an investor going to make any money out of this only because people i mean basically we make the same amount of money per cap the more cabs we put up the more space we've got you know how am i going to make money out of this tell me numbers,,
3686,Return on Investment (ROI),you've got a real innovation here i'm trying to figure out where your stage we're at so i can figure out how one might make some money on the thing,,
3688,Return on Investment (ROI),what's the earning capacity of investment into a pole dancing studio,,
3689,Return on Investment (ROI),jasmine's you've got a hundred thousand dollars invest in it tell me about three years what can i expect as an investor,,
3690,Return on Investment (ROI),so what's that going to turn into how are you planning to return that?,,
3691,Return on Investment (ROI),how would i make money on a deal like this it seems like a little business a little bit of sales doesn't seem like there's room for a third person by any means,,
3692,Return on Investment (ROI),if i go in at$ 130k for 10% sharewhat is it going to be worth in 5 years,,
3693,Return on Investment (ROI),what is it is the only way that an investor can get a return so you actually want you and double return you want your equity repaid and you wanna continue through royalty which is different it takes a risk on stuff you're saying here regardless for sales i want the money back after 24 monthsand i'm gonna keep my equity,,
3694,Return on Investment (ROI),make you know 20 million dollars next year what's five percent of 20 million dollars?,,
3695,Return on Investment (ROI),are they money making products for me to invest in?,,
3696,Return on Investment (ROI),i don't think i'll make a return i think it'd be a bad investment and for those reasons i'm out,,
3697,Return on Investment (ROI),so not only do we put money into this deal but we have to put money into the first two or three property deals as well do we into the first few loans to get what returns will we get on those,,
3699,Equity/Ownership,no what percentage would you do a deal at or do you want to go with that deal are you able to match that deal,,

3722,Equity/Ownership,thirty percent if we did take ten eachwould that be feeling too steep for youor is that something you would considerit'd be on a suitable valuation uh yeshonestly on the valuation that we'vebasically all come toyep,,
3723,Equity/Ownership,"so listen you need $100,000 basically for inventory that's your problem we don't have enough product all right i like this deal it's very simple to understand i'll give you the $100,000 i want 30%",,
3725,Equity/Ownership,would you consider coming down to20,,

3730,Equity/Ownership,dave when you're asking these guys in are you willing to give up more equity for more money and that's what i'm trying to figure out so they can even know how to position themselves,,
3732,Equity/Ownership,y'all can't even do25?,,
3735,Equity/Ownership,who is the person that came up with a brilliant idea of only offering us 6%?,,
3736,Equity/Ownership,for how much,,
3737,Equity/Ownership,200k for25% was that an offer i didn't quite get that i think they understood and that's all i'm interestedin,,
3739,Equity/Ownership,but i think 50% is a little bit much to giveaway seen as all of the work that we'veput into the business to startwith so would you consider30%?,,
3743,Equity/Ownership,how much of the company do you intend to give up for the hundred fifty k?,,
3744,Equity/Ownership,is the 10 percent no negotiation?,,
3745,Equity/Ownership,if someone would still feed the moneywould you allow ownership of those 18piecesto the personthat gave you the money the investoryeah until they got the investment backbut it wouldn't be a problem,,

3762,Equity/Ownership,are you offering them 300 000 for 50 percent?,,
3763,Equity/Ownership,"so you're only offering 7 half% of basically $140,000 after tax you can distribute think about me as an investor i can take the 250 put it into a reap making me 9% that has tremendous distribution or give it to you at the risk that you you somehow stumble on the roll out it's not that attractive",,
3764,Equity/Ownership,who owns the business,,
3768,Equity/Ownership,what shares do you own in the country?,,
3769,Equity/Ownership,so you're thelargest shareholder now correct,,

3810,Equity/Ownership,do you have a counter offer just to prod and poke you into a negotiation here can we so no no that that um you're not even going to counter with some percentage mate you're just going to say no i think you know let's just not talk at all is that where you're at yeah so 5% it 5% or nothing i'm going home absolutely,,
3812,Equity/Ownership,"375,000 bucks for 15% correct?",,
3814,Equity/Ownership,what's your percentage split between the two of you in the business?,,
3815,Equity/Ownership,do you own any shares in this 20%?,,

3823,Equity/Ownership,give us the company's shareholding,,
3824,Equity/Ownership,if we went in together would you consider20%,,
3825,Equity/Ownership,would you consider coming down to 20.,,
3827,Equity/Ownership,would you do it at 30.,,
3828,Equity/Ownership,"i'm proposing to invest $75,000 in exchange for 40% equity in your business.",,
3831,Equity/Ownership,do you now yeah i do so this is what i see a really great guy who's pretty straight up and i know i could work with you thank you thanks nate i live in the online world but i do understand brands and i understand creating brands i understand innovation and i believe in great australian innovations o the offer that i'm going to put to you is nothing like what you've asked for okay i offer you a hundred thousand dollars for 15 of your business and a two hundred and eighty thousand dollar loan because you're going to need the cash thank you very much for the offer yeah i'll leave that with you thanks,,
3832,Equity/Ownership,the decision is a hard one do i need i want it yes please so i said yes a hundred thousand dollars for 15 yes and a 280 000 loan so you get the cash that you need right now uh-huh i've offered 380 000 yes i still think it's a good deal right for 35 equity which will be there yes until someone else injects more equity that percentage won't change i will get a five percent royalty up until the point that three and eighty thousand dollars is all repaid,,
3833,Equity/Ownership,what is the difference between their two offers the biggest difference between their two offers he gets his equity for free i'm paying for it so you're paying for it the difference yeah i'm paying for 15 percent yeah at 100000 which is a real kind of realistic valuation given the your forward orders saying 35. on your numbers that should take me about two two and three quarter years if your numbers are correct to get that paid back sure thanks very much for the offer steve um thanks very much for the offer naomi i guess i'm going to i am actually going to take one of you and accept the offer but steve just at 35 it's just too far up there i would rather partner with naomi build the business build the brand use your pr expertise in your marketing great advocate and at the end of the day you know if you're offering that money and then pay that back that's a wonderful thing for us so i would love to take your offer,,
3836,Equity/Ownership,is there anything that you would be able to shift on in terms of your percentage what would you propose,,
3837,Equity/Ownership,would you consider 20,,
3839,Equity/Ownership,would you two guys consider 35 percent?,,
3840,Equity/Ownership,seen as all of the work that we've put into the business to start with so would you consider 30 percent,,
3843,Equity/Ownership,would you take it if he offered you equity?,,
3846,Equity/Ownership,would is thatdeal would you consider 25%?,,
3847,Equity/Ownership,so you've asked for forty percent from,,
3849,Equity/Ownership,if we have a kickstarter project that does reach above 200 000 pounds would you be willing to go down to 20,,
3850,Equity/Ownership,my wife has 50% i have50% how about just a little slideadjustment and go 33each,,
3851,Equity/Ownership,so could you tell me the offer again,,
3852,Equity/Ownership,you own a hundred percent between you now,,
3853,Equity/Ownership,so you're offering 20 of the whole company correct,,
3854,Equity/Ownership,so are theinvestors providing debt or they arethey getting equity in return what is soinstrument with the 20 of the businessfor 80 000?,,
3855,Equity/Ownership,so steve what i would accept would be a 2 million um 100take outif anyone can take this business it's stevei really believe thatand he might even give me a jobthat's discussionmaybe um no i'm not gonna negotiate against myself you should have kept one of these four in the gameso if you're at twowe're probably not going to meetis that where we're at,,
3857,Equity/Ownership,would you have any wiggle room onpercentages them kind of the top myself michael friend we're looking at was 25%?,,
3860,Equity/Ownership,would you talk to us for20 percent,,
3861,Equity/Ownership,"would you be interested in 50% for 500,000 with the three of you negotiating",,
3862,Equity/Ownership,how negotiable isthat,,
3863,Equity/Ownership,would you accept 200 000 pounds for 25,,
3864,Equity/Ownership,what is the shareholding of your company right now?,,
3866,Equity/Ownership,what are the investors getting for that what's what are they buying into getting us yeah and you're getting apart of the 15% share of the existing business and the cash flow,,
3867,Equity/Ownership,would you and obviously that's a large jump from from our initial conversation but saying that i think what what about if we we went into it together side by side and we would have a completely even split 50% we would still learn from you and be open to what you say so i don't think there would be an issue with if you think one thing that we would want to go the opposite way but i think we'd probably can consider and be quite happy with a 50% 50/50 share you congratulations by wrecking that hundred stores maybe a bit of an under estimate perfect partner that's that's a great deal you've done right do we get free iron training bullets just where maybe a friends,,
3871,Equity/Ownership,just let's forget the negotiation you just tell us your best and we'll say yes or no,,
3873,Equity/Ownership,"so you came here looking for 300,000 for25% you're going to sell 40% with hisoffer he's going to lend you $200,000which the business has to pay back whatare youthinking",,
3875,Equity/Ownership,why are you only giving us five percent and why did you ask for five hundred thousand dollars?,,
3877,Equity/Ownership,i want to understand a little bit more about your partner you mentioned you brought apartner in for 5% and more importantly what triggers the 40%,,
3878,Equity/Ownership,what percentage do you have now?,,
3879,Equity/Ownership,so at what point do we dilute you past the point you no longer care about that's this rhetorical question i don't expect an answer for it sorry okay all right i'm jumping out?,,
3880,Equity/Ownership,one and a quarter million for how much?,,
3881,Equity/Ownership,"i'm really feeling that you're going to be requiring more than the 40,000 in terms of you're going to be looking for me language is anger the value that i gotta look for 50% of the business and i'm going to give you the full 40 tests do you want you ever think about that",,
3884,Equity/Ownership,so how much do you want at what percent,,
3885,Equity/Ownership,what's the deal going to look like do you think?,,

3918,Equity/Ownership,what is the shareholdingsplit?,,
3919,Equity/Ownership,so what percentage did you say you would do a dealer i suppose it we understand that there has to be a bit of wiggle room and and we did come in looking to give away 10% but we would be willing to give away more if like we got a dragon on board it's it's worth it's worth more to us,,
3920,Equity/Ownership,how's the company share structure now,,
3921,Equity/Ownership,why don't we offer well a million dollars there's not enough in there there's not enough in there no but a million dollars for 50 percent,,

3948,Equity/Ownership,would you be willing to get on board both of you and split that would be our preferred combination i know i need to do here and i'd rather not share okay that makes it difficult for us can we think about it,,
3949,Equity/Ownership,whether you would like to match his terms my job is to grow value in your business and it feels a bit odd to say i'm going to go 100 miles an hour but i'm going to actually lose equity it feels counter-intuitive would i,,
3951,Equity/Ownership,who owns the business just the two of you,,
3952,Equity/Ownership,so what's a share split,,
3954,Equity/Ownership,so clarify that's 2.5 million dollars for 50% from the business?,,
3955,Equity/Ownership,if you got your money back you'd be willing to drop down to 5%,,
3957,Equity/Ownership,i'll make you an offer the offer is twenty thousand dollars for ten percent which is what you've asked for in addition to that a fifty thousand dollar loan and a royalty which is twenty dollars per board back to myself for the first thousand boards?,,
3958,Equity/Ownership,i'd like another 25 i'm happy to split the loan with him uh and go 40 40. but that would mean collectively we would own half the business?,,
3961,Equity/Ownership,i think we're both worth 40 percent and on that basis plus the loans you've got access to eighty thousand dollars minimum definitely bother me too much if you don't want to do the lane i'm happy with that?,,

3966,Equity/Ownership,how much are you prepared to sell would you sell more than 20 percent,,
3967,Equity/Ownership,can we spit the difference and steve and janine are asking for 25 one quarter of your business for 180.,,

3971,Equity/Ownership,i don't know if you can sell me 50% of the company who owns it?,,
3973,Equity/Ownership,do you expect us to be really interested for 1.7%,,
3974,Equity/Ownership,what kind of percentage do you have,,
3977,Equity/Ownership,i just want to do a reality check here you're about to think about an investment that's coming to your business that will dilute you you'll go from being a 51 shareholder to quite a lot less than that they'll both be just around 30 30 each and the new shareholder will be 40 percent how do you feel about that,,

4093,Equity/Ownership,you're not even going to counter with some percentagemate you're just going to say no i think you know let's just not talk at all is that where you're at yeah so 5% is it 5% or nothing i'm going homeabsolutely,,
4097,Equity/Ownership,"i'll give you the $300,000for 25%.",,

4135,Equity/Ownership,would you consider 33 percent?,,
4163,Equity/Ownership,how is the sharestructured as of today?,,
4164,Equity/Ownership,t is there any way you'll drop even to12 and a half%,,
4169,Equity/Ownership,so the loan will be repaid and then the person lending you the money will be left with forty five percent of your company that's correct,,
4170,Equity/Ownership,would you be willing to do 125 000 for 10 percent,,
4171,Equity/Ownership,would you be willing to go up to a hundred fifty thousand dollars for 15,,
4172,Equity/Ownership,would you be willing to do 125 000 for 12 and a half percent and then two and a half in advisory shares,,
4173,Equity/Ownership,is there a percentage that you would feel like you had skin in the game and could be a partner for me in this,,
4174,Equity/Ownership,would you scale an investment with that at 1.5 million for 15. because it's still the same math right it's linear at that point,,
4178,Equity/Ownership,what percentage are you looking for for how much,,
4180,Equity/Ownership,"i'm going to make you an offer o $75,000 which is what your request is for 35% in other words i'm trying to undercut this bugger cuz i think i'd be a better partner thank you nme okay you ready yet no not yet okay",,
4188,Equity/Ownership,how do you react to a hundred and twenty thousand for forty percent,,
4190,Equity/Ownership,are you interested in that deal if we were pre-revenue i would consider 25% but because we have sales it would be unwise of me to entertain 25%,,
4192,Equity/Ownership,you spoke about co-founders what is the shareholder,,
4195,Equity/Ownership,"you're looking for 140,000 for 20%right?",,
4196,Equity/Ownership,talk to you about the current shareholding off of your of your company,,
4198,Equity/Ownership,what's the maximum percentage you'd give you must have had that figure in your mind as well,,
4201,Equity/Ownership,you're coming here for not only our money but our strategic assistance butthey're only offering u s 10 why wouldyou offer us so little,,
4202,Equity/Ownership,what percentage which round was that,,
4203,Equity/Ownership,"a dv for the valuation, you got a $2.1 million valuation 2.3 2.3 sorry yeah that's right what are the investors getting for that what's what are they buying into you're getting us yeah and you're getting part of the 15% share of the existing business and the cashflow",,
4208,Equity/Ownership,can you get the percentage lower,,
4209,Equity/Ownership,see if you could do 20 for the 2.5,,
4210,Equity/Ownership,how about 22 and a half,,
4211,Equity/Ownership,and they had twenty thousand twenty percent of the company for that yeah,,
4212,Equity/Ownership,"i wanted you to come back to me to give me your absolute maximumshareholding you would give away in yourcompany so we don't have to get into atactical sort of bit of dogfight withregards to share what is the maximumyou'll be willing to give away fromreceiving 125,000 pounds",,
4214,Equity/Ownership,like what about 25,,
4218,Equity/Ownership,do you want to take the 30 000 and give up one-third of your company you got to make a decision yes or no,,

4231,Equity/Ownership,what's the split in the businessequity,,
4233,Equity/Ownership,i'm delighted with the offer do you have on the table i'm just wondering was there any way of negotiation in terms of the percentage but i think we will need more cash injection in the little while man perhaps and is there any way you'd move maybe to a fifteen percent each and move it down to 30 percent,,
4234,Equity/Ownership,what are you looking for in terms of money and equity,,
4236,Equity/Ownership,so we were wondering if there is something that can be done this would actually make you also the largest shareholder yeah well wouldn't it and it'd be the first time that we've actually broken where we don't have equal shares from the business so it is a big step for us to let something like this go,,
4237,Equity/Ownership,so just confirming that's 178000 for eight percent?,,

4382,Equity/Ownership,that's too much you think so probably about 50 percent,,
4383,Equity/Ownership,have you made an offer on every guitarbusiness it's every time there's aguitar i always make an offer myhusband's got five guitars we're tryingto capitalize on an opportunity rightnow so we have to ask ourselvesis that opportunity worth 25 of thecompany,,
4384,Equity/Ownership,is he still own part of it?,,
4385,Equity/Ownership,what would you offerme,,
4386,Equity/Ownership,i haveasked for 30%do you want to have a discussion aboutit might be a good ideayeahokay thing is it's not gone very wellwe've beenslaughtered what do you think we shoulddo,,
4387,Equity/Ownership,would you be preparedto move to25%,,
4388,Equity/Ownership,if i was to offer you the 50 000 pound for 95 of your company what would you say,,
4389,Equity/Ownership,the question is 8%isn't enough,,
4390,Equity/Ownership,"what do you think about $250,000 at 20%",,
4393,Equity/Ownership,it's the companyshareholding split evenly betweenyourselves at the minute so anybody knowstars yesafter percentage we're waiting for athird party,,
4394,Equity/Ownership,do you have a percentage in mind?,,
4395,Equity/Ownership,"so you're looking for $150,000 for 10%",,
4396,Equity/Ownership,what are you going touh how does 15 sound to you guys sounds less is there any sort of room formovement i mean initially i was askingfor 10 so 30 does seem like a pretty bigfight,,
4397,Equity/Ownership,um andrew what about does 20 soundreasonable to you would you do 20 for300 000,,
4398,Equity/Ownership,what do you own mate?,,
4400,Equity/Ownership,what percentage was that i'm really welly you've just said the top percent or five percent of really i'm really not gonna be terribly interested about either so i'm i won't be investing am i it's a shame a shame would interest you?,,
4401,Equity/Ownership,is there any way we i mean it's very difficult for us to accept an offer of 12 and a half percent when we have offers on the table at ten so our first question to you would be would you be prepared to match the 10% that these two have on the table?,,
4402,Equity/Ownership,we feel that 10% is as far as we can move from or 3% if we can go to 10% and we have a deal?,,
4403,Equity/Ownership,you're 100 of shares between you,,
4404,Equity/Ownership,i'd like to know a little bit about the price i tell you he's 56 years of age gentleman he leaves it to me the young buck who was jumping up and down on the roof i'm just trying to understand you both put in the same amount more at twenty five thousand each you do all the work and yet he has 50%?,,
4405,Equity/Ownership,is there any negotiation on that,,
4406,Equity/Ownership,how negotiable is a percentage of equity they are offering well it depends on how much you're willing to put any of that and i suppose that's where let's suppose there's been a hundred thousand what's what work was it would you offer if it was just the money yeah,,
4407,Equity/Ownership,how much equity have you got in this right now,,
4408,Equity/Ownership,"anyone going to come down to 10% and we can doa deal right now and get in early for200,000",,
4409,Equity/Ownership,you own 100% between you,,
4410,Equity/Ownership,so you're offering 20% of the whole company correct so there for all three of you will be diluted back,,
4411,Equity/Ownership,100% owner in no i'm not oh i have two co-founders yes um and then we have umone investor and we gave the manufacturing company 10% right and you own the majority the three founders own 55%and how much do you own,,
4415,Equity/Ownership,i just wonder whether if you got yourmoney back you'd be willing to drop downto five percent,,
4416,Equity/Ownership,what percentage of the company would you give to me,,
4418,Equity/Ownership,what's the percentage of the company that you're offering today,,
4419,Equity/Ownership,so every single subscriber that you have you give a dollar to him to repay the 50000 right until it gets to a hundred thousand dollars so he basically wants double his money and then i'm out right and then do you have any equity i don't own a single cent of your business,,
4420,Equity/Ownership,what percentage is your offer sorry,,
4421,Equity/Ownership,"would you be willing to either go down to 20% with that deal or if we did the 30% would you be able to go up to 200,000 for the investment",,
4422,Equity/Ownership,so what are we buying here,,
4423,Equity/Ownership,is the 10% negotiable,,
4424,Equity/Ownership,how about16 just to make me feelgood,,
4425,Equity/Ownership,what are the investors getting for that what's what are they buying into you're getting us yeah and you're getting part of the 15% share of the existing business and the cash flow,,
4427,Equity/Ownership,okay so what do you feel comfortable with?,,
4429,Equity/Ownership,so the equity breakdown is 50/50?,,
4431,Equity/Ownership,who owns a company,,
4433,Equity/Ownership,would you guys consider 700 between you guys for 30 15 each,,
4434,Equity/Ownership,would you guys consider 700 between you guys 30 percent,,
4435,Equity/Ownership,so how much the business do you own at the moment,,
4437,Equity/Ownership,just explain that why would you exclude the i p from the deal if you're looking for a partnership,,
4438,Equity/Ownership,do we even know what you still own yourselfout of the company,,
4440,Equity/Ownership,at what point dowe dilute you past the point you no longer care about this?,,
4442,Equity/Ownership,200k for 25 was that an offer i didn't quite get that i think they understood and that's all i'm interested in so brendan you're the numbers man yes 200k for 33 i'll give what you want 200k for 20,,
4443,Equity/Ownership,we were wondering two things one andrewwould you considercoming down in yours at all i'm liketwenty yeahtwenty percent two hundred and oh comeon you're not we're we're the sameare you rejecting my offer all right nowe're definitely not we're our nextquestion is this would you consider pairing up with any of the other sharks,,
4444,Equity/Ownership,does that mean ten percent each isn'tyeah yes yeah so it's ten percent eachfor glenn and i we're both putting in ahundred thousand,,
4448,Equity/Ownership,so what do you feel comfortable with,,
4449,Equity/Ownership,would you be willing toagree a deal of10% so 5each,,
4455,Equity/Ownership,i'm going to make you an offer i'm going to ask for double the equity uh for the 100 000. so a hundred thousand dollars for 45 of your business,,
4456,Equity/Ownership,is there any room for negotiations at all with percentages with the 45 percent to me it's not about 20 to 45 it's it's a risk the real question you should be asking yourself is which deal do i accept so that the 55 percent i have left is worth a lot more than it is today because today it's not worth that much,,

6652,Scalability,i just wonderis this a high-touch businessproposition rather than just a high techproposition i wonder should you be goingthrough a type of franchise licensingbecause there's a lot of teachers aroundthe country they're looking forsomething to do during the summer theycould run the summer camps for you doyou not think that you have to grow thatway plus have the technology platformmaybe that is that is something you needto look at,,

6679,Scalability,can't see where you're going to find those economies of scale in this business sure,,
6680,Scalability,they're notoriously difficult to scalearen't they because they're all aboutideas and innovation the investmenttherefore is a newand i'm just struggling to see what theinvestment opportunity is,,
6681,Scalability,jonathan fundamentally i have absolutelyno idea how this would translate into ascalableinvestment okay period literally icannot imagine howand the exit opportunity is selling ateam of peoplenotoriously hard to do um and i don'tsee how i'd ever make money on itso i i won't invest,,
6683,Scalability,how did you arrive at 23 places,,

6687,Scalability,"can i just jump in if that's all right right i mean when you when you organize a party it's more visual it's it's almost like design you know you want to you want to go into a store and pick stuff and have fun with it enjoy the experience and i think that's where the opportunity is right i think every time we open a store we will add 700 to a million worth of turnover for every store we open basically and another 1 or $150 to $200,000 worth of profit for every store we open?",,
6690,Scalability,how long would it take you to get a thousand retailers,,

6725,Scalability,what what's the plan to scale?,,
6728,Scalability,one of my concerns about this is that you need to be operating a nationwide business picking up this class what does that require by year three in terms of staff,,
6732,Scalability,how scalable is your business because there's one of you?,,
6733,Scalability,you're planning to make a hundred thousand in turnover absolutely i what would stop you getting their marketing dollars i just need to market this business problem how many subscribers will you think you'll need to convert we want to get to 6000 subscribers in the next years,,

6744,Scalability,howbig do you think the business can get,,
6747,Scalability,what's your bottleneck rightnow in at the moment?,,
6748,Scalability,what evidence can you give me that um this business is going to get to a big enough scale?,,
6750,Scalability,why can't you just check additional serviced offices where you are,,
6753,Scalability,is there any way of scaling it is there any way of protecting this do you have any?,,
6754,Scalability,how many sites that requires,,
6755,Scalability,there's only two two of you and you currently said you're doing everything but you've got programs in every single state yes who's doing the selling in all states,,
6756,Scalability,quite often people come here and they go the us and all this sort of stuff but the time the time the money like you really need to put away two million dollars to launch into that market to get people on the ground and to have the stock that's why we've decided to go with medical distributors because they have marketing on their own costs yes we supply them with ammunition to go and support the product out there but it's a really low cost we run really lean,,
6757,Scalability,if i'm in perth and i go right i want to clean my car now with only 18 contractors right now would i get that in 15 minutes,,
6758,Scalability,is the goal to go back to the lab and introduce 15 new products or is the goal to go from to kibble and just scale where you're at to scale it the treat to enter the market?,,
6763,Scalability,how do you plan on uh growing these numbers from a supply perspective if you're currently making it in a pot with a wooden spoon,,
6764,Scalability,when you get to your 800 stores that you've mentioned how are you going to do that,,
6765,Scalability,"how did you arrive at 23 places 21 21 21 sorry we wanted to keep it as a boutique model and that was the minimum amount of children or spaces for an actual sense i asked the questionsimply because for a facility like that you've got fixed coststrue true the next model up was i thinkaround 4045 but a lot of the children get quite overwhelmed being in biggroups of people so yeah that was our decision it's a good thing up in 21families it's even better when you help 45 families i think personally all right true and so our next aim would be them to open a second centre once we perfect that model with another 21 childrenwould you not get a facilitaterelatively easier to expand you'll get more efficient so you got 24 percent of your expenses here how to do with yournon wage expenses effectively right this is a good business this should happen there's $80,000 enough to get off the ground and going definitely and you'll get cash flow to support around",,
6766,Scalability,if we wanted to scale it upwould you be able to get the highquality of ingredients because that'swhat we're selling here,,
6768,Scalability,so that's a little bit disappointingbecause you you told us you've comparedit on five companies and none of themare comparable really because i know acouple of these companies and they'reall losing huge amount of money they'reputting tens of millions of dollarsso i just need to understand how you'regoing to get to the 150 million poundvaluation exitand scale and grow your business whenthere's no other example of a d natesting supplements company that's everbeen made successful or been sold,,
6769,Scalability,how big can these socks get?,,
6771,Scalability,are you able to extract money from your current cash flow to put it aside to scaler,,
6772,Scalability,so where do you take that brand further for instance could you do corn snacks the brand can move could you do fizzy?,,
6776,Scalability,i'm just trying to understand what you think you need more when you're doing amazing right now,,
6777,Scalability,"how do you solve that problem that's only based on producing 10,000 units that price so i'm hoping once it the you know manufacturing goes up the price is going to come down?",,
6778,Scalability,what's stopping you're not having a ten in the next year,,
6779,Scalability,is this not something that you'd you'd kind of go on the road with if the location was right,,
6780,Scalability,and you could change what you put inside correctly by country,,
6781,Scalability,is there anything else about that material or any other application that it can be used for apart from this,,
6784,Scalability,how many how many um designers doyou want to grow to on the continent,,
6785,Scalability,as you scale your sales up have you already thought about if there's a way of automating the production process?,,
6787,Scalability,have youmastered that and are you ready to scale that?,,
6788,Scalability,so how do you want to grow thatbusiness,,
6790,Scalability,how many franchises is that in three years then,,
6794,Scalability,20 grand it's not much it's not going to get you very far is it if all of a sudden you got an order for a hundred thousand of these what would you do?,,
6795,Scalability,would you not get afacility that's relatively easier to expand you'll get more efficiency you've got 24 of your expenses here are to dowith your non-wage expenses effectively right,,
6797,Scalability,are there any roadblocksto get into a building like to thesecurity guard to pull you up or we'refriends with all the security guardsthe concierge is in some of the higherhigh-class buildings they love us aswell so i don't know why i don't knowit's the perfect productwhat's the plan to scale,,
6798,Scalability,how would i expand with you to other destinations outside of the mediterranean whatever you want to do and however you want to achieve it?,,
6800,Scalability,is itfranchise is it partly frozen cooked athome the execution risk is huge there'sa million moving parts to get this frombeing a nice brand to something that's areally big business and i ask myself ami the guy to work with you and get youthere,,
6801,Scalability,you're growing three and a half times fast too where are we going to be in three years from now,,
6802,Scalability,if all of a sudden you got an order fora hundred thousand of these what wouldyou doum bank plans?,,
6804,Scalability,how many of these machines do you think you can install- in places that have the space...,,
6825,Scalability,how is that going to work as you scale up are you concerned about that are you wanting to create mini you,,
6827,Scalability,one of the questions i suppose that weyou'd have to have isobviously the galway food company worksreally great in galwayum but you know cork are very proud oftheir food tradition anduh other places are proud of theirs howdo you think it will play out,,
6838,Scalability,would you not get a facility that's relatively easier to expand you'll get more efficiency you've got 24 of your expenses here are to do with your non-wage expenses effectively right,,
6860,Scalability,"the supply side of your business yeahif suddenly you got an order for 10,000units yeah just how you'd handle that",,
6861,Scalability,are you trying to to get us to invest in just this shop or are you trying to roll this out and develop hundreds of stores,,
6863,Scalability,what would happen if i invest in your business and i said to you i've got great contact in your favorite store,,
6865,Scalability,so tracy if you were doing 111 000 whydo you think a franchisee can doan extra 30 percent more than you'vebeen and you're the experthow do you think a franchisee will dobetter,,
6866,Scalability,if you have if you have twice the amount of members you're going to get more trainers,,
6867,Scalability,are you n nationwide at the moment?,,
6869,Scalability,give me a quick franchise model sure so have you projected what sales you're going to get for a franchisee?,,
6871,Scalability,but a good a good pole dancer doesn't make a good business person or a good pole dancer doesn't make a good franchisee so you got to kind of get the combination that's why the the pool gets smaller and smaller andsmaller,,
6872,Scalability,would you like to be in the coals and woolies of the world in other words that it becomes our normal would you like that?,,
6879,Scalability,what is your next step and what's your next big volume jump are we still in the irish market are you looking ahead and if you're looking ahead have your meeting set up have you doors opened are you at the start stage?,,
6880,Scalability,so where are you going to doublethat growth from,,
6881,Scalability,what'slikely your maximum production comingthrough your facility on a per day basis?,,
6883,Scalability,how big do you think this can be this is the next phase of health people are fed up of being misled about what goes onin particularly in soups and writing meals yeah i think i think there really is no limit with this i think it's a suite of products that needs to happen and we need to move fast we've a swiss distribution company who wants our product yesterday,,
6884,Scalability,how much money are you going to have to raise to make this a national success,,
6885,Scalability,does it not worry that you that if you do get one of thesesupermarkets on boardyou know you aren't with a manufacturingpartner who can just scale quicklyyou've literally got to somehowmake that work,,
6886,Scalability,how big can it get?,,
6888,Scalability,sowhat are the three cities you'reintending to operate in,,
6889,Scalability,how quick do youplan a gun to go faster,,
6890,Scalability,so you you reach maximum capacity well they don't grow any bigger so that's themodel,,
6891,Scalability,how many franchisees is that in three years then?,,
6892,Scalability,why bother with the other product when there's so much potential still left to go is that not just confusing,,
6895,Scalability,how you could scale this?,,
6896,Scalability,how big can he get,,
6897,Scalability,tell me a little bit about the production and how will you be able to scale of production to meet demand sure,,

6899,Scalability,what else beyond eggs can you make it an entire business around?,,
6904,Scalability,what's likely your maximumproduction coming through your facilityon a per day basis?,,
6905,Scalability,so you're looking for more product or ideas to pushthrough thisdistribution channel?,,
6906,Scalability,so what you're saying is if you get this investment you're going to 5x your production and your revenue is going to be at a much higher margin that's exactly right yeah,,
6908,Scalability,could you train someone else to runthose programs?,,
6909,Scalability,if you get up to let's say 50 000 a year what sort of cost of goods could you get from your supplier you think you could get that down to two euros for example,,
6911,Scalability,how many franchises is that in threeyears then?,,
6912,Scalability,what do you think you've got abig growth down there to do we haven'teven scratched the surface,,
6916,Scalability,your margins are about to get nailed uh you could end up with some volume issues are you concerned at all about not concerned about success and the ability for you to reach that scale?,,
6917,Scalability,you are if they want to grow this business you want to take a nationwide i'massuming yes you don't still plan on using the direct employee model to dothat do you,,
6918,Scalability,have you made the enquiries to if youdid get 50 000 what were they,,
6919,Scalability,you said you make it by hand but youalso said you're in 800 storesyes have you nothing else in your lifebeen making,,
6920,Scalability,why wouldn't you knock this out of the park first why are you trying to diversify before you've nailed one,,
6921,Scalability,six hundred schools is two of you easier so do we have to clone like twenty of you to operate around the country,,
6922,Scalability,can you help me understand how you can scale this so i can make a massive return on this great business of yours,,
6923,Scalability,yeah but i can't quite understand how you got to replicate and clone yourself to provide your consistent quality across the market,,
6924,Scalability,how many children can you accommodate,,
6925,Scalability,and if you had ten thousand units could you sell them all tomorrow?,,
6927,Scalability,fundamentally i have absolutely no idea how this would translate into a scalable investment,,
6930,Scalability,what are your plans to grow the business?,,
6933,Scalability,what's the size where where could this go to make this a decent size business cuz the turnover so far hasn't been that big has it no it's so new but is that is that because of volume?,,
6934,Scalability,my question is how quickly can you step up your ability to capture more plastic for me that's probably one of my my smallest concerns tell me why then so i then i'm not worried yeah so the drop off points they build such a community and it's what gets people involved and you build off other businesses communities to get the plasticin,,
6935,Scalability,so how are you going to do that,,
6936,Scalability,what's your plan to take this forward,,
6940,Scalability,would you not get afacility that's relatively easier toexpand you'll get more efficiency you'vegot 24 of your expenses here are to dowith your non-wage expenses effectivelyright?,,
6941,Scalability,what are you gonna do i wanted to find out a little bit more about what you both think that you can bring and you help us expand into global market you have been alive 18 months yeah business hasn't beaten you down yet and so you're still in that blue sky period yes,,
6946,Scalability,"but that's view can i just jump in if that's all right i mean when you when you organize a party it's more visual it's it's almost like design you know you want to you want to go into a store and pick stuff and have fun with it enjoy the experience and i think that's where the opportunity is right i think every time we open a store we will add s100 to a million worth of turnover forevery store we open basically and another 100 or $150 to $200,000 worth of profit for every storewe",,
6948,Scalability,do you know what the capacity is of the manufacturing facility?,,
6949,Scalability,how do you scale it so you can sell a million of them,,
6951,Scalability,andrew do you think that this is the kind of product that you could push into the states,,
6952,Scalability,how do you achieve your big heraudacious goal,,
6953,Scalability,how are you going to improve it,,
6954,Scalability,so you put on one class you teach the other trainers how to do it and then you leave to another city?,,
6955,Scalability,how does it get bigger,,
6956,Scalability,so i'm trying to figure out how does this become a 100 million pound business where do your sales come from,,
6957,Scalability,"whatis the plan with scaling upproduction for, 1400 store we neednearly $1.8millionw wow wow",,
6958,Scalability,andis that one of the reasons that's l edyou to go down this path do you feellike it's going to be a more simplisticbusiness to scale,,
6960,Scalability,as i understand it at the moment thebusiness model isi will find bloodworks dot ie onlinebut i have to go and see you in apharmacy that's correct there isn't apossibility down the road thatyou know i can put something on myfinger and present and istick it in the post to you or orsomething,,

6965,Scalability,so you think a store could do more than that if it was optimized and we've got a growth rate of about 12% per month currently,,
6966,Scalability,so you have something overseas then do you not,,
6967,Scalability,how are you going to get to the point where you have enough people where you can sell enough that it matters?,,
6968,Scalability,you will be able to supply massive demand?,,

6972,Scalability,what's your plan or strategy to grow this business are you going to work on it full-time?,,
6973,Scalability,you probably don't know but you do come across as a little bit spiky when you're talking to investors you know engage with them don't push against them you know because you've got five people here looking to put money into businesses anyway um expansion for you right now outside of scotland is the wrong thing to do consolidate get these landed okay do that first before you do any more please okay thanks again for that for me your whole expansion plan it's just too early so for that reason i'm afraid i'm out appreciate it guys thank you,,
6975,Scalability,is this something we can get to 100 million or is this going to cap out of 10?,,
6979,Funding/Investment History,do you have any debt,,

11370,Intellectual Property,is there anything to stop them doing it and no other isn't,,
11372,Intellectual Property,the question ishow much of a premium lies an investorpaying for the risk that this is notproprietary anywhere,,
11373,Intellectual Property,is it patented?,,
11375,Intellectual Property,have we protected it,,
11376,Intellectual Property,is this product your creation you've got the recipe is it,,
11377,Intellectual Property,so you don't own the i p on this one,,
11379,Intellectual Property,have you patented this,,
11381,Intellectual Property,and what's the copyright around the sound files cuz presumably you're downloading the sound files from somewhere,,

11395,Intellectual Property,so yeah that's australian patent and have you applied peyton pending in australia and we obviously do want to look at international because there's nothing like it worldwide,,
11399,Intellectual Property,is there anything in that processthat is patentable that is unique to youthat you can keep,,
11400,Intellectual Property,so you're protected and you're worried about the public seeing it,,
11402,Intellectual Property,do you have payent protection?,,
11403,Intellectual Property,you own the recipe right?,,
11404,Intellectual Property,high nearly brand do you own that,,
11406,Intellectual Property,do you own the technology?,,
11408,Intellectual Property,so what have you done to protect it?,,
11409,Intellectual Property,where are your patents registered?,,
11410,Intellectual Property,did you get the patent?,,
11411,Intellectual Property,so for me the whole thing lies in the value of the patent so what i want to do is look at the patentable step in this and why it's so important and is it easy to circumnavigate i'm guessing it's that folding it's the folding mechanism isn't it it's the flipping this one up so you see how the shelves into equalsize yes it says the top yeah that's the bit of this pattern so equal length spacings that allow the unit to fold completely flat okay you will not get a patent on two pieces of wood of equalsize that fold,,
11412,Intellectual Property,and what level of confidence do you havewith themthat they won't put your personalizeddesign on their websitethat's a good question and something iactually haven't delved in probablyenough with i have talked to them aboutdesigningfrom myself literally sending themdrawings and that would then beofficiallyjust mine there would be a contract withthat and the cost of that is opening amoldof 60 euro and so at the moment i'm notthere yet but it is a plan in the nextyearbut i think as i go bigger and as youhighlight that i think i do need to geta contractin place,,
11413,Intellectual Property,have you protected the concept by way of patent or other,,
11414,Intellectual Property,you haven't patented this productno why,,
11417,Intellectual Property,do you have any type of i p coverage,,
11424,Intellectual Property,i'm assuming you have some sort of patent or trademark on that correct it's,,
11425,Intellectual Property,have you got the patent on this have you?,,
11426,Intellectual Property,james yep is it a pattern that you've applied foror is it a pattern that you've actuallyyes we've probably been granted no it's an apply for pattern so we've got 1212 to 18 months before it's granted if there's no objectionsand when did you apply,,
11427,Intellectual Property,well process of getting the glass through the filling machine you could have appliedfor the patent for the machine beforeyou started manufacturing the machinewell we had to get the we have tounderstand the way that the glass was accepted to the to the machine youdon't understand it before you started making the mission well basically i've it's brand new it'sa brand new technology it's brand new to me so we've actuallyyou know it's a little bit of you know a brand new company,,
11428,Intellectual Property,is this product your creation you've gotthe recipe is it,,
11429,Intellectual Property,so they own the final recipe for this productso you don't own the i p on this one,,
11436,Intellectual Property,do you have a design patent on any of these,,
11437,Intellectual Property,did you apply for a patent?,,
11442,Intellectual Property,so you haven't got a trademark overseas and you're trading overseas yeah we do we have a trademark uh but the trademark et the patents more important to me currently when we actually send these over that we'll put the trademark in as well um just when you were sort of saying trademarks you haven't done those and the patents and my my head was just going ching ching ching with the cost and the the valuation is also 22 times next year projected profit yeah for me that's an extraordinary valuation for those reasons i'm out okay can i just go back to that and just and thank you for bringing those up,,
11446,Intellectual Property,is there anything in that process that is patentable that is unique to you that you can keep,,
11450,Intellectual Property,have you got the patents for india,,
11451,Intellectual Property,so we filed in 2008 in india um still waitingwe're hoping that it comes through we understand hope's not a strategy but you know it's a it's a challenging market in its own right so we are waiting for for an approval,,

12383,Valuation,yes the business you're offering us whohas got no track record no evidence ofsuccess you're valuing it at1.7million are you familiar in the retailspace of food what sort of multiple sortof things are and what really the realvalue of it,,
12384,Valuation,"soyou've made 300 ,000 net profit andyou're offering 15% of that business for15",,

12403,Valuation,well i want to hear about sales because you value this business at seven million dollars that's a whole lot of poo poo,,
12404,Valuation,so why is the business with a hundred thousand in sales worth half a million dollars,,
12405,Valuation,so why is this worth 2 million bucks?,,
12408,Valuation,it's 300 000 bucks what would you value this business at,,

12422,Valuation,what did you think your chances were to get 10 million dollars,,
12427,Valuation,so you're giving us a 5 million valuation on australia this business here australia?,,
12428,Valuation,just to confirm you won 56 000 for ninepercent so you're valuing your company622000.,,
12432,Valuation,i think that you have a product here you have a early adopter customer who's trialing it so you obviously believe that they're going to say yes even then you're only talking about a company that will probably lose money or break even in its first year i would have thought 12 months from now then you have a business that has not made a profit or has made a marginal profit and now you're 12 months before that and yet you're evaluating at 1.5 million i got to tell you guys i would have had an interest in this business i'd be willing to put in 75 k but i would expect somewhere on the order of 20 to 25 percent of the business for that therefore i'm valuing you at 150 k for around half the company somewhere in that order 40 to 50 percent and obviously i correct me if i'm wrong you're not interested in that deal absolutely that case with great regret i wish you good luck but i'm out,,
12433,Valuation,why don't you try and defend why this is worth $2 million?,,
12435,Valuation,is 12 of the businessworth the expertise 42.,,
12438,Valuation,"so that's was $75,000 for 20% so you're valuing your company at about 375 true?",,
12439,Valuation,"so if you've outgrown your kitchen youcould talk about some pretty healthynumbers then to support your $375,000valuation what do you reckon?",,
12440,Valuation,why wouldn't you advise him that his valuation is completely insane,,
12442,Valuation,you value your business at5 million how do you justify that,,
12443,Valuation,"this brand that's worth5 million is this the same brand that's producing24,000 in net profit",,
12444,Valuation,do you want to sell 40 for 40 bucksabout do 15 bucks each 30?,,
12447,Valuation,these do require appropriate questioning so if you're trying to rush the process why are you trying to rush the process and we're talking about a 16.6 million dollar valuation for god's sake it's money people this is business,,
12452,Valuation,was that 5 billion?,,
12453,Valuation,so we're going to turn 5 million into 5 billion?,,
12454,Valuation,does it feel like $5 billion?,,
12457,Valuation,why do you think the company's worth seven hundred thousand dollars,,
12458,Valuation,many can you give me value an approximate figure,,
12463,Valuation,"so you're looking for $2,000 for 20% of your company valuing it at a cool $1 million?",,
12464,Valuation,you've put a valuation of your businessover seven million that's correct justtalk us through your logic on how youarrived at that valuation,,
12465,Valuation,is there any way that you would considera lower valuation on the business likebut we're not talking half we're talkinglowerforeignpartnerthen that the value that that partnerwould bring would would be so huge forusso we would consider it,,
12466,Valuation,so you're looking for 250 000 for seven percent so you're valuing your company at around 3.57 million?,,
12467,Valuation,explain to me why his valuation of 3.57 is wrong?,,
12469,Valuation,so then how do you justify the $10millionvaluation,,
12470,Valuation,who where or what has thisvaluation come from did you do it or didyou get help with the valuation,,
12471,Valuation,isn't itworthit,,
12473,Valuation,what does that evaluation itmakes it a million dollar valuation,,
12474,Valuation,i mean if you're asking $8 million valuation you must be earning plenty of revenue and profit?,,
12475,Valuation,"so if you you made 400,000 before tax last year what are you going to make next year because that's how i'm going to value your business next year?",,
12476,Valuation,so you're asking why are we valuing at it say 8 million for example?,,
12479,Valuation,how do you value your business at 2.6 million when you've sold 100 given away it's been going 2 years and you still got seven in stock?,,
12480,Valuation,would you invest 2.6 million in this?,,
12481,Valuation,can you explain where you've got your two million dollar valuation please?,,
12483,Valuation,what you see on the screen is the tip ofthe iceberg as a comparison i have had aquote from a large u.s developmentcompanyjust to build a simple prototype of thiswould cost a hundred and fifty thousanddollars a prototype four hundredthousand dollars for them to developthis as an app,,
12485,Valuation,so 750 for 25% so you're valuing your business at 3 million correct,,
12486,Valuation,what's he selling it for,,
12489,Valuation,do you think there's a little extreme ask in terms?,,
12490,Valuation,can we go 20% at the what does that make the valuation,,
12493,Valuation,but for a $20 million valuation i'm guessing you've already sold a lot of these yeah,,
12494,Valuation,at what valuation,,
12495,Valuation,"but how do you get to half a million pound valuation because if if you look at my figures you'll see by year five i'm turning over approximately 700,000 so what you're all saying is you're valuing the business in five years time",,
12501,Valuation,where are we coming up short with the numbers we gave you?,,
12502,Valuation,how much for 2.2 million?,,
12503,Valuation,you said 300 000 for 51 yes that's a bit unusual actually so you're yes everyone investors control i wanted to get it out there because we we can't do it on our own and we and everyone that family and friends that have seen it just think it's a great idea no one can ever deny it's the best thing i've ever seen from the first time we made the toy and we take them to a painting attorney they just wow why didn't anyone think of this words i heard from the highest painting attorney in the country,,
12504,Valuation,two hundred thousanddollars for five percentfour million valuation on a businessthat makes no money this is a businessmodel not yet fine-tuned i'm out,,
12506,Valuation,you validated over a million how did you arrive at the valuation i understand it's potential value,,
12507,Valuation,all right guys i'm just looking at itand saying to myself okay how do i getthere as an investor you asked me for 15here for 150 000 that imputes a milliondollar value okay as an investor howmany times am i paying to get to thatmillion value,,
12508,Valuation,what does possibly offering us three million,,
12509,Valuation,james just so i can go back to the thequestion i asked you previously you value your businessat a million pounds and i said is that on the strength of your letter of intent to which you said yes it was yes and now we've established that we have no orders yep soit's a verbal they've given us a verbal indication of what they're looking to doas a venture capitalist do you think ivalue businesses on some vague statement that somebodymakes or do you think i base it ontangible numbers,,
12510,Valuation,james i think you've asked for a ridiculous amount of moneyokay i think you should have come in here and said i'm not sure what i've goti've got a verbal arrangement but hey it's a punt and if it works it could be good for youi would have invested in that but you've placed yourself out of the market 250000 pounds is ridiculous,,
12511,Valuation,why is your company worth a million pounds?,,
12512,Valuation,there's another number i'm not clear on sesa you said your original raise was at a $7 million valuation our series a and today what's your valuation that you're asking 5.5 yes why are you doing a down round,,
12513,Valuation,you got a valuation of 2.4 million on your business haven't you,,
12514,Valuation,how did you arrive at that number,,
12516,Valuation,300 000 bucks what would you value thisbusiness at,,
12517,Valuation,"so what have you done that justifies your valuation of $300,000",,
12520,Valuation,"so you're asking for $90,000 for 25% yes which values your business at 360,000",,
12524,Valuation,you're looking for an investment of a hundred thousand dollars for 10 valuing your business in a million dollars?,,
12526,Valuation,a big valuation yeah i mean if you're asking 8 million valuation you must be earning plenty of revenue and profit?,,
12530,Valuation,so you're valuing this at the moment pre-revenue at 2.7 million?,,
12531,Valuation,have you come up with a 2.7 million,,
12535,Valuation,what value,,
12537,Valuation,i'm trying to value your business because i know you need the money to expand yes i'm just struggling a lot,,
12541,Valuation,"so that was $200,000 for 20% so you're valuing your business at $1 million?",,
12542,Valuation,do you think 25 of the equity in your company is worth more or less than 10 cents a unit in perpetuity and he's supposed to talk where is he going to take you it doesn't matter it does matter because you keep 25 of this business which may sell 10 million of these and you keep it all for yourself but you're going to be keeping nothing because he doesn't know how to get this out any success you're an idiot you don't know what to do,,
12548,Valuation,so that's a pretty intriguing valuation six hundred and eight thousand dollars for 23valuing your company at 2.643million dollars that's correcthow long you've been working on it,,
12549,Valuation,what was thevaluation that your partner came in at?,,
12550,Valuation,do you really believe that that it'sworth that much more?,,
12551,Valuation,what's your vision for this business two visions i guess the first vision is to have a range of hex the second vision of that is that one day why would you need pegs when you can just use heads yeah why hang it when you compare why peg it when you can hang it is what i say so just to reiterate 10for 380 000. so you're valuing your business at 3.8 million that is correct,,
12552,Valuation,what were they smoking when they made that valuation i'm sorry but you don't have the sales to support that so we can all ignore that valuation can't we at this point in time because you're not going to get 3.8 million if you get a deal here today right you're valuing it like a far more established business with several million in revenue with far more structure than you've got okay i'm out thank you very much,,
12553,Valuation,have you yeah being generous at sort of between hundred and ford and turner okay in net profit right and if you look at that business that that's a business at about a five to six times valuation but i love what you've done and i'm i'm trying to make a deal on my bit of paper that makes a bit of sense to me one of the things i i like ex south australian boy and so you know i'm coming from that really trying to support a fair income australian entrepreneurial person and business all right so i can look at the i can look at the 380k let's do that for 35 but i'm after i'm up for a royalty and it'll be five percent up until the point that 390 000 is all repaid thanks very much steve for the office and i bring with it 30 years of marketing pr experience and i bring ibring about 15 years of experience in internet and apps that should be really helpful yeah that's right,,
12556,Valuation,you're looking for 632 000 for 15 of your company valuing your business at a cool 4.21 million dollars is that correct?,,
12557,Valuation,so jenny that's 350 000 for 10 of your company so you're valuing your company at 3.5 million,,
12558,Valuation,so you're valuing your company at around a million bucks that's correct yeah exactly a million dollars exactly nice round figure that's terrific and uh it was chrissy yes correct and are you two related in some way?,,
12566,Valuation,what do you think the australian business is worth?,,
12567,Valuation,do you have tons of sales like because you're asking for 200 000 for two and a half percent,,
12571,Valuation,so i think my original question wasknowing the performance of the businesshow do you get to 2.5 millionvaluation,,
12572,Valuation,why considering that we have had approximately uh 65 000 profit i think it's a fair price would you agree,,
12573,Valuation,yeah where's that derived from,,
12574,Valuation,i think my business is worth about 10 times the profit if i evaluate it uh so that would bring it to about 600000 uh which would be 15 is that a fair way to evaluate it,,
12575,Valuation,justify a 1.1 something million dollarvaluation,,
12576,Valuation,so you're valuing your new business at a 2 million bucks,,
12578,Valuation,how much is that,,
12579,Valuation,you're seeking a millioncorrect at 20 20% you're valuing this at$5 million no,,
12580,Valuation,how do you how' you get the 10million or 5million you're a scientist walk usthrough the data i'm not being flippanthere,,
12581,Valuation,well done andrew and that's uh valuing your business at 3.9 million dollars 390000 for 10wow so uh i guess you better show us how it works,,
12582,Valuation,so these do require appropriate questioning so if you're trying to rush the process why are you firing rush the process and we're talking about at sixteen point six million dollar valuation?,,
12584,Valuation,what have you valued this business at 545 000 pounds why,,
12586,Valuation,yeah 14 14 percent for 75k is just it'sjust out of the questionyou haven't got contracts you haven'teven got something you're selling at themoment you're not making any profit sowhat i would be backing as you guys andan idea so what kind of realistic equityslice could you offer me,,
12587,Valuation,can you explain where you've got your $2 million valuation please,,
12588,Valuation,you want 56 000 for nine percent so you value your company 622000.,,
12590,Valuation,so how did we get to a two million valuation as we know it?,,
12592,Valuation,but you've valued this but two million pounds correct give me a good justification and reason why this is worth two million pounds today,,
12594,Valuation,another partof the valuation that i've been you knowtold to look at are similar companiesand their valuations so a company by thename of teeny tell ya they do a wearablemobile phone and tracker as well yeahand three years ago a prototype stagethey were valued at six million dollarsyeah did they own any i p yes they didyeahwere they first to market they were oneof the first to market yes tick it's mypoint yes i totally understand that andthat is why i need to join together withthe manufacturer and work together andjointly own the i p,,
12596,Valuation,you valued your business at 250 000?,,
12600,Valuation,you're after 23 times profit projected profit 23 times the projected profit well you wrote a 2.3 million dollar valuation on a hundred and something thousand in profit right hundred thousand that's about 23 times okay when you say that out loud it's it's an interesting statement right,,
12601,Valuation,"so you're valuing the business at 300,000 or less because you've got control but that's what it's worth that's all it's worth right now actually in genuinely we're only talking let's put in perspective you're valuing it on big plans but the reality is you're one store that hasn't even had 12 months with a tray and in fact that's all you've got",,
12602,Valuation,i'm not even interested to gopartnership worldwide with anyone atthis stage okay i'll make it really easy i'm out okay so for a five milliondollar valuation you must have some ideaof the revenue you're potentially ownedfrom this thing one day yes,,
12604,Valuation,so that's a pretty big ask 1.5 million yes for 20% yes valuing the company at 7.5 million today and obviously you got a big hope for the future within 3 years we think the can turn over an annual revenue of $90 million with a net profit of 35% what is the product cuz it smells kind of unusual,,
12606,Valuation,how did we get to a two million valuation,,
12607,Valuation,so 750 for 25 so you're valuing your business at 3 million correct,,
12611,Valuation,did you do it or didyou get help with the valuation,,
12614,Valuation,so you're valuing your new business at at 2 million bucks?,,
12615,Valuation,but you're valuing your business at close to a million bucks?,,
12616,Valuation,hayley this is my offer for you is for a hundred thousand dollars for the 21 plus a hundred thousand dollars in loans because you need the capital so that effectively halves your valuation?,,
12617,Valuation,you're looking for a million and a quarter if you were to do that for well thirty percent of the firm get down under three four million dollar valuation i would certainly be there i'm in on that offer?,,
12620,Valuation,that was seventy thousand dollars for ten percent that's right you're valuing your business at around 700 000. that's correct or exactly 700 yep,,
12621,Valuation,the seven hundred thousand dollar valuations making me sweat a lot,,
12622,Valuation,so i'm assuming you've got a value extra 2 million yeah and did you missthat last number by the way cuz thatmade me gasp yeah minus 180 n i'm goingto i'm going to you got a valuation of 2million yeah so i'm assuming somewhereyou got 1.8 incash,,
12626,Valuation,so that's an increase in valuation in a very short space of time so you've more than almost tripled the value of your company,,
12628,Valuation,when it boils down to it you have no protection on this so the only thing that you're really selling is the nameyou're asking for an investor to value this name at 200 000 poundsit's a great night,,
12629,Valuation,you've got an evaluation here of well over three million dollars,,
12630,Valuation,did you put any money at the valuation in,,
12631,Valuation,why is this thing worth 7 million bucks,,
12632,Valuation,800 grand for what i want to know why it's worth 1.6 million dollars?,,
12633,Valuation,if i offered you 30 million dollars for the company would you take it,,
12635,Valuation,you're asking too much,,
12636,Valuation,so you must have huge sales because you're putting a value in your business of over four million dollars,,
12638,Valuation,explain why you're worth $16.6 million?,,
12639,Valuation,so you're looking for uh 200k at a 2 million valuation 10,,
12640,Valuation,so did he did heengineer the two million dollarevaluation or do you have somemathematics behind them,,
12641,Valuation,so you valued your business at two and a half million yes so tell us about the revenue numbers because i'm sure they're gonna just blow us away,,
12642,Valuation,so how did you come to a valuation of 2.5 million,,
12644,Valuation,do you think 50 of groove book is worth of today?,,
12645,Valuation,you're valuing the company you're asking for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for seven percent correct correct you're saying the company's valued around 1.75 why are you valuing the company that that's a great question before we launched the trademarks and the patents from and you turn the turned it down yeah yeah what shame on you are you,,
12646,Valuation,talk to me about how you come up withthe valuation,,
12647,Valuation,so that's 400 000 for 20 valuing your at 2 million correct,,
12648,Valuation,okay so you're valuing your business at two million correct,,
12651,Valuation,the valuation of of $1 million for a product that you never put out it,,
12653,Valuation,you're going to give $2 millionvaluation you raise that much money atand give away basically a 30-yearcompany at that point,,
12655,Valuation,"but why such a high valuation i mean right now you're asking $175 ,000for 10% if you distributed $100,000 ayear and i made 10% off that that's$10,000 a year i would have it wouldtake me 17 years to get my money back doyou understand what you're asking",,
12656,Valuation,the business you're offering us whohas got no track record no evidence ofsuccess you're valuing it at 1.7million are you familiar in the retailspace of food what sort of multiple sortof things are and what really the realvalue of it,,
12657,Valuation,so you're valuing your business at 250,,
12663,Valuation,so youput a 750 000 valuation on your businessyes so you've got to tell me how you gotto that valuation,,
12665,Valuation,so can you give me a like for likethat's sold,,
12666,Valuation,do youunderstand why it's really importantbecause it gives me a gauge of howimportant this is for the people thatare investing andyou're wanting money from mea very very ridiculous valuationbecause you have a completely non-provenmodel,,
12667,Valuation,can you walk us through how you came up with that delusional valuation,,
12668,Valuation,what valuation are you buying them out,,
12670,Valuation,how in the name of the lord did you come up with a valuation like this you're looking for a hundred thousand and you're offering five percent of the company as,,
12671,Valuation,of two million euro on this idea that just has a patent pending you were leaking credibility as far as i was concerned,,
12673,Valuation,you've got 750in okay i think that influenced you alittle bit and asa yesso you add that to the value so it's5.75 million yeah holy smokers guys yeahcorrect almost six million dollars,,
12674,Valuation,it'snot my responsibility to pay for pastmistakes yesterday's history tomorrow'sa mystery we're in the day today rightwhat you need to do is look what thevalue is today and by my calculationit's worth maybe on the high endhalf a million bucks yeah yeah great,,
12675,Valuation,how did you calculate your valuation?,,
12676,Valuation,so what's it worth then?,,
12677,Valuation,you're projecting for 2019-20 profits of two hundred and eighty thousand euro which would only put the value that you're asking for today on a multiple of four five six that should sell a business like this,,
12678,Valuation,at what valuation?,,
12679,Valuation,i can't get to the 2 million help meout there,,
12680,Valuation,make me another offer under 2 million,,
12681,Valuation,what gives you the the maples to come out here and say you're worth you know a million dollars?,,
12684,Valuation,you validated over a million howdid you arrive at the valuation areunderstand its potentialvalue,,
12686,Valuation,is 12 of the business worth theexpertise?,,
12688,Valuation,just to confirm 500 000 for 10 so as you say a valuation of 5 million?,,
12690,Valuation,you validated over a million how did you arrive at the valuation,,
12693,Valuation,"if you had 800,000 000 cashtoday would you buy thisbusiness honestly knowing what i know i would",,
12694,Valuation,so that's 100 000 for 20 so you're valuing your business at 500 000 correct,,
12695,Valuation,so that's 25 000 for 25 valuing your business at a 100000?,,
12698,Valuation,so you're valuing your business at 250.,,
12700,Valuation,so i'd like you to just explain to me why you've gone for such a crazy valuation with so little profit,,
12701,Valuation,"which values the company at 250,000 you're were asking me to invest a million pound valuation yes and before you've walked through the lift doors you've done a deal valuing the company at 250,000 yes so why didn't you pitch that why didn't you asked for 50,000 for 20%",,
12703,Valuation,what's the visionfor why it's worth 4.6 million dollars,,
12704,Valuation,you've valued your business at a million pounds that's right yes and you're definitely old enough to be slightly sensible yeah jeff so what's what am i missing?,,
12705,Valuation,1.3 million is roughly what you value?,,
12706,Valuation,that's um two thousand dollars two and ahalf thousand each?,,
12708,Valuation,and you had a 2.5 million dollar valuation correct,,
12709,Valuation,is there any way that we could persuadeyou guys to come slightly closer to theevaluation that we've started with,,
12710,Valuation,why is it worth 10 million today let's let's be sober about the valuation,,
12711,Valuation,why have you come in here with such a ridiculous valuation,,
12717,Valuation,just to recap you're looking for a hundred and eighty thousand dollars for ten percent valuing your business at one point eight million?,,
12718,Valuation,so 750 for 25 so you're valuing your business at 3 million correct?,,
12719,Valuation,"there's got to be a lot of these out there there's nothing proprietary about what you're doing my question really goes to the 400 ,000 or 5% imputes an $8 million valuation yipp yoai yay you must have aton of sales?",,
12720,Valuation,so you're looking for uh 200k at a 2 million valuation 10?,,
12721,Valuation,so did he did he engineer the 2 million dollar evaluation or do you have some mathematics behind them?,,
12723,Valuation,so that's a hundred thousand dollars for 20 so you'revaluing your business at 500 000 correct,,
12727,Valuation,guys how did you arrive at your evaluation that you presented,,
12728,Valuation,that's what you think yourbusiness is worthhang on you better have some sales honey,,
12729,Valuation,why is this worth two million dollars,,
12730,Valuation,but why is it worth two million dollarstoday,,
12732,Valuation,so just walk me through slowly how you can justify such a big number in such a young business,,
12734,Valuation,you're looking for six hundred thousand dollars for forty percent of your company valuing it at 1.5 mil that's a big percentage that you're prepared to give up that's correct yes take us through the numbers can you,,
12736,Valuation,so did he did he engineer the two million evaluation or do you have some mathematics behind it?,,
12738,Valuation,so you're valuing this brand new business at 1.2 million?,,
12739,Valuation,you're looking for 250 000 for 10 so you're valuing your company at a cool two and a half mil,,
12740,Valuation,so how do you then value your business at two and a half million with all that risk,,
12754,Valuation,"i'm still struggling to find out why you think it's worth 400,000.",,
12757,Valuation,so just to reiterate 10 for 380 000 so you're valuing your business at 3.8 million that is correct right now the sales don't warrant the valuation so tell me about next year,,
12759,Valuation,"what's the i p that you own that's proprietary,that actually is valuable, other than,""i've got a product ready to go to the market""and i've sold 1,500 units""and that's why i justify a valuation of 2 million today""?",,
12779,Valuation,i do not understand how you think you can value this at 4 million.,,
12784,Valuation,if you believe you're going to make600 000. my offer isfar far far better than peers,,
12794,Valuation,are you serious?,,
12800,Valuation,but you're asking for 700000 valuation on the poncho and the blanket,,
12837,Valuation,"s o w hy w ou ld y ou o ff er u s...t hi s--5%...r ig ht. f or $100,000? t ha t m ea ns y ou a re s ay in g t he v al ue o f y ou r c om pa ny i s $2 m il li on.",,
12853,Valuation,i'm not sure whether 80k is enough but i don't think it's materially out of the ballpark you're doing good you've actually got a realistic valuation if you're forecasting that to be true,,
12868,Valuation,so just to clarify that you're seeking a hundred thousand dollars yes for 20 which values your business at half a million dollars?,,
12877,Valuation,i can't wait for you to justify that number.,,
12885,Valuation,"i'm just struggling with... $300,000 for a 5% imputes a $6 million valuation.",,
12895,Valuation,"$250,000, 5% gives you a $5 million valuation.",,
12900,Valuation,so you're valuing your business at 3.8 millionthat is correct right now the salesdon't warrant the valuation so tell meabout next year,,
12901,Valuation,so you're looking for uh 200k at at a $2 million valuation 10% i am,,
12902,Valuation,price why 1.98 million it's not number i just recall my solicitor saying you need to be able to just bring it in at under 2 million bad advice if you approach a high net worth individual you can be any amount you want tell me why only hates because i happened to be in the hotel business and eight is not a number that's normally considered viable you're right eight is not viable with eight units it doesn't make very much money it pretty much just covers expenses how on earth do you expect to repay the debt what's that sorry the i don't know how you can pay the loan off in five years,,
12903,Valuation,how do you impute a $6 million valuation in the business that's very hard to justify,,
12906,Valuation,what's the net asset value of the business at the moment,,
12907,Valuation,glenn would you be interested in a conversation about investing in the whole business um to be honest that i wouldn't want to go down that that avenue really why um if you if you put 250 ah if you for every thousand pounds you invest in the set the end line product once we've made them then there's one thing about a guy that's been in business for 30 years you ain't going to be able to diversify my train of thought by giving me some willy story about this if you've got a business that has an asset value of 2 million quid you're asking me to put 250 000 pounds into a company that has no assets why would you not entertain a conversation about me coming into the whole what would you bring to that business that would oh yeah in terms of i mean just i don't quite know what to say you really should be coming in pitching the whole business but you didn't want to do that because you want to keep it for yourself this is definitely not investable so i'm out okay thank you thank you,,
12909,Valuation,what would you value this business at?,,
12910,Valuation,how do you justify a1.1 something million valuation,,
12912,Valuation,you said three hundred thousand for fifty one percent yes that's a bit unusual actually so you're,,
12913,Valuation,why people aren't really going over this valuation?,,
12914,Valuation,why do you think we would ever invest in a company at this level with a $2 million valuation?,,
12915,Valuation,what's your value in dresses you have in the business place,,
12916,Valuation,"tasty tasty fellows why is a business that's doing $200,000 in salesworth $15 million?",,
12917,Valuation,as that got the provenanceon it somewhere can do because when youkeep saying can-do we're doing thatwe're developing this and so on and soforth so i'm disappointed where you'reat in four years there's too much thatyou're still thinking about and to comein here and say your business is wortheight hundred thousand is poppycock atthis stage so i'm out,,
12918,Valuation,"so you're looking for $200,000 for 20% of your company valuing it at a cool $1 million?",,
12921,Valuation,did they invest in your company for that 50 yeah absolutely at what valuation,,
12922,Valuation,you got a valuation of 2.4 million on your business that's right yeah it's quite a big valuation for a business obviously that's starting out yeah umhow did you arrive at that number,,
12923,Valuation,and it's forty five thousand dollars for fifteen percent of the company great which values your business at three hundred thousand so what have you done that justifies your evaluation of three hundred thousand dollars?,,
12925,Valuation,is that in line with everybody's expectations,,
12926,Valuation,"is there any way that you can justify the $10 million valuation $500,000 in sales",,
12927,Valuation,"you've obviously delved into the complex numbers area because 800,000 is a very hefty evaluation could you just talk through the model in terms of the payments how do we i mean let me figure out how we're getting to that 800,000",,
12929,Valuation,"you valued your business at a $250,000 yes i'll say that slowly that's a quarter of a million dollar yes how did you arrive at that number",,
12931,Valuation,you've come out with a valuation of three hundred thousand pounds for your business yes and that must have been through a crystal ball or a figure plucked from the sky,,
12934,Valuation,"you came inasking for$625,000 for 5% now typically no onecomes in with that kind of ask unlessthey have some kind of sales to back",,
12936,Valuation,do you think there's anything odd about valuing this company at 1.5 million dollars,,
12938,Valuation,you be able to do a 10 million evaluation,,
12944,Valuation,"$400,000 for 5% that's the value proposition?",,
12952,Valuation,so i'm assuming you musthave one and a half million pounds inthe bank to get a valuation of1.6,,
12953,Valuation,"so you're valuing your company 622,000 do you think you could show us right now yeah yeah then we'll understand what you're pitching okay i",,
12958,Valuation,what i'd like to understand is when you talk about a company that's worth 20 million dollars 500 000 for 2.5 20 million valuation i know and respect that you're going to have sales and lots of users when did you start it how much did you sell when you started and how have you been going on theyear-over-year basically sureum,,
12959,Valuation,how much money could it come down if you didn't have the app,,
12962,Valuation,how much do you think your idea is worth what value have you put on your idea?,,
12963,Valuation,you sold 800 worth of goods yes and your 850 worth of turnover yeah is worth half a million pounds?,,
12964,Valuation,so really you've come in here with a valuation of four million?,,
12967,Valuation,"so you're looking for $200,000 for 20% any company valuing it at a cool $1,000,000?",,
12970,Valuation,so that's a pretty intriguing valuation six hundred and eight thousand dollars for 23percentvaluing your company at 2.643 milliondollars?,,
12973,Valuation,what's the value of that,,
12975,Valuation,so you're valuing your business at 3 million?,,
12976,Valuation,so you're valuing the business at a cool 5 million correct,,
12983,Valuation,so why and how are we going to justify a $10 million valuation?,,
12987,Valuation,it's a pretty big valuation you put out there 10 million dollars you're after 1.8 million yeah,,
12988,Valuation,let's have a look at the numbers let's do it so why and how are we going to justify a 10 million dollar valuation,,
12989,Valuation,um i want to try and get into the details fast as possible and actually because you've come in with a reasonable concept but i just want to hit the elephant in the room straightaway you have a valuation of 5million,,
12993,Valuation,how is this business worth two million dollars today,,
12997,Valuation,i'm confused about thevaluation so you're obviously not makingany profit at this point correct butyou're valuing it at 1.25correct could you explain where you getto that valuation plan definitely sothat's how we valued our businesseswithin the growthpotential,,
12998,Valuation,what is absolutely crazy is your valuation this is completely unproven and the question for me as always is the reward high enough for me to take the risk course,,
12999,Valuation,do you really think as an invention it's worth it right now or in year 3?,,
13003,Valuation,i want you to tell me why you justify your company being worth three quarters of a million pounds when you make diddly squat?,,
13004,Valuation,what's the justification for your valuation?,,
13005,Valuation,with your own numbers you've clearly demonstrated that you've overvalued the business,,
13006,Valuation,why did you just keep it in the existing business 80 grand for 5%,,
13007,Valuation,so it values a company of$1.1 million yeah you're an investmentbanker at least you were one you thinkis that little extreme ask in terms of val,,
13009,Valuation,why would anybody pay this guy 300 grand for what he has now?,,
13012,Valuation,so thelast round we raised on pre-money saveso six million cap i'm happy to meet you somewhere just sothat i don't go under thatwould you be able to do 500 000six percent but i'll give you a threepercent advisory shares just so itdoesn't hurt my my valuation as much butyou'll get the same amountdone,,
13015,Valuation,and what's that land worth approximately?,,
13016,Valuation,why you're worth seven milliondollars,,
13020,Valuation,how do you like the valuation,,
13022,Valuation,so then how do you justify the 10 million valuation,,
13023,Valuation,where or what has this valuation come from did you do it or did you get help with the valuation,,
13024,Valuation,how do you value your business at 2.6 million when you've sold 100 given away 100 it's been going two years and you've still got seven in stock?,,
13026,Valuation,so four hundred thousand dollars forfive percent that's the valueproposition yes,,
13027,Valuation,a big valuation yeah i mean if you'reasking eight million dollar valuationyou must be earning plenty of revenueand profit,,
13028,Valuation,so why are you worth 30 times thisyear's numbersumso you're asking why are we valued atsay 8 million for example,,
13029,Valuation,can you come back to me with anotheroffershe's asking you to negotiate againstyourselfoh she's got it because evaluation'sridiculous,,
13031,Valuation,what am i going to do with youtoo,,
13034,Valuation,4months $1.6 millionvaluationwow and that's where i'mstuck,,
13035,Valuation,why don't we just jump right into the looming question here you want $1 million for 5% that means you're saying the company is worth $2 millioneven the ring guy wasn't that aggressivewhat's the reasoning behind that,,
13039,Valuation,so you're valuing your company at a modest 3.5 million dollars that's correct just checking just checking seems like a lot,,
13040,Valuation,i'm concerned about your valuation i've taken your profit which i've estimated about 200k for this financial year we're in right now yes and you're after 3.5 million which is nearly 18 19 times that but i see your product has a great position in the marketplace so i look i'm sitting at 350k for 33 i think that's not valuing the the licensing potential the the global potential right so what's your calendar offer to them,,
13041,Valuation,you're valuing your business at 1.3 million and you haven't sold a product yet,,
13042,Valuation,but why would you invest in something that is worth for something in three years at the price today for me,,
13043,Valuation,but why so why is it worth 1.3 million today,,
13044,Valuation,so you're looking for two hundred thousand dollars for 20 of your company valuing it at a cool one million dollars?,,
13045,Valuation,so frank and tracy you're looking for632 000 for 15 of your company valuingyour business at a cool 4.21 milliondollars is that correct?,,
13047,Valuation,for that you want a million dollar evaluation?,,
13048,Valuation,had the substances worn off when you came up with the one million dollar valuation?,,
13049,Valuation,so busy that was 65 000 for 20 of your company why don't you show us a bit about your product,,
13050,Valuation,we're negotiating a hundred dollars what are you moaning about?,,
13051,Valuation,but what gives you the the maples to come out here and say your worth you know a million dollars i'm it's i'm i'm stunned your business isn't even worth 200 000 right now regardless of your past million dollar offer it there's nothing to do here because i'd have to get a hundred percent of the company and still i wouldn't feel i had a good deal if i gave you two hundred thousand dollars,,
13053,Valuation,make us counter would you be able to do uh 10 million ofvaluations?,,
13054,Valuation,what valuation is a $65 million round debt?,,
13055,Valuation,"why are you offering us 250,000 for 5% and if i did the numbers you're giving us a 5 million valuation today?",,
13058,Valuation,so what what makes you think that the business is worth a couple hundred thousand,,
13059,Valuation,so you valued your business at two and a half million,,
13060,Valuation,600 grand revenue so how did you come to a valuation of 2.5 million,,
13061,Valuation,you asked for a hundred and fifty thousand five percent correct so three million pounds you value this product,,
13062,Valuation,many do you think then you need to sell to make your company worth three million pounds,,
13063,Valuation,so you're valuing it around 660 is that right?,,
13064,Valuation,so for a five million valuation you must have some idea of the revenue you'll potentially earn from this thing one day yes can you let us know about sales you're expected,,
13067,Valuation,does it feel like five billion dollars mate or what?,,
13069,Valuation,so why is this worth two million bucks?,,
13072,Valuation,how do you justify a 1.1 something million dollar valuation,,
13073,Valuation,so it's a million dollar valuation,,
13074,Valuation,how did you arrive at that,,
13075,Valuation,so you're valuing your company at a modest 3.5 million dollars?,,
13076,Valuation,i've taken your profit which i've estimated about 200k for this financial year in right now yes and you're after 3.5 million which is nearly 18 19 times that but i see your product has a great position in the marketplace,,
13080,Valuation,you've got a valuation of a half a million pounds so let's get these big numbers what are they ladies,,
13082,Valuation,but you put a value on this of a million dollars you've made no money yeah we're we're ready,,
13084,Valuation,could you explain where you get to thatvaluation plan definitely so that'how we value our businesses within thegrowth potentialokay so given how much we've expanded inthe lastperiod um with an influx of that sort ofcapitalwe can definitely take our business tobe a 1.25 million dollar company that'staking itfrom your accounting background you youknow that it's sort of normallybusinesses are valued ata profit with a multiple of how big thatgrowth is correctnow i know obviously you can't multiplyzerobut um 250 000is a lot of moneyyeah so let me let me justexplain to you what 250 000meansif you think of your what we would callyourprofit on this item you'd be lucky toget a return of50 cents per unit to your shareholderit's probably more likely to be 10 centsso how many do you need to sell at 10centsprofit to return the 250 000to the investor,,
13087,Valuation,how do you value your business at 2.6 million when you've sold 100 given away 100 it's been going two years and you've still got seven in stocki mean i mean is there some magic formula to this is this something we're not seeing themagic formula hasn't happened yetbecause what's happened is please expecti had to have it tried and tested firstso in my head i knewthat this product was sellable and thati was confident selling 2.6 million2.6 million so i've been to an accountant oh nono no no no he's actually drawing mythingdon't do it that changes everythingbut i had to have him work out figureshe said to me basically i can sell atleast 100000 in the first year,,
13088,Valuation,i'm stillwaiting for the justification of the 2.6million valuation because youdid your spreadsheet with your accountyep but do you have a purchase order?,,
13091,Valuation,i'm trying to value your business becausei know you need the money to expand yesi'm juststruggling a lot,,
13092,Valuation,so i'm trying to value your business soi can make an offer,,
13093,Valuation,what are you thinking,,
13097,Valuation,confirming three hundred thousand for twenty five percent because actually you're valuing this brand new business at 1.2 million?,,
13098,Valuation,how are you justifying a four million dollar valuation,,
13099,Valuation,did you come up with evaluation yourself,,
13101,Valuation,what do you think the value of your office space is what rent can you get for your office space,,
13102,Valuation,"but we have got apretty hefty valuation on this business80,000 for 8% that's a million pound business isn't it yeah on something that's only turned over a quarter of a million and made very little money so far so how do you justify that large valuation based on the pro what the retailers would like to acquire based upon its future potentials?",,
13105,Valuation,so you are asking for 200 000 for 20 valuing your business at 1 million?,,
13107,Valuation,you're currently valuing the business at 2 million euros,,
13108,Valuation,what's what's your value and dresses you have in the business please,,
13109,Valuation,"so you're looking for$150,000 for 10% so you're valuing yourbusiness at $1.5 million",,
13112,Valuation,300 000 bucks what would you value this business at?,,
13114,Valuation,from the valuation seems very optimistic talk to me about how you came up with the evaluation,,
13116,Valuation,how did you guys come up with evaluation it's it's really high it's for your sales yeah so how did you get there?,,
13118,Valuation,you value this at nearly 2million,,
13119,Valuation,you're valueing this business at 1 ahalf million you sure some of thosehaven't got c bd inthem,,
13120,Valuation,so thecompany has nothing we have theeverything sorry sorry but what you'vegot is this concept and the plan to buytwo aeroplanesyes and you're valuing it at a millionpounds,,
13123,Valuation,edwin so did he did he engineer the two million dollar valuation or do you have some mathematics behind them,,
13125,Valuation,can you explain where you got yourvaluation from we've sold onlineum in the past month 150. about 100.,,
13126,Valuation,i still can't get my head around youwant you're valuing the business atfour million dollars the reason behind that is we have no competitionnumber one number two we have a visionthat itwill be in every home in the near future,,
13127,Valuation,you're valuing the business at 8 50.,,
13128,Valuation,why a dollar then,,
13129,Valuation,how did you arrive at that number?,,
13131,Valuation,yeah why do you think it's worth three million,,
13132,Valuation,so i'd love to dig into that point straight away an answer then why you think it's worth it,,
13133,Valuation,what at what valuation,,
13136,Valuation,so you value the shops,,
13137,Valuation,so you're seeking a million dollars correct at 20 20 you're valuing this at five million dollars,,
13139,Valuation,do you know what the five million dollars is about respect it's about respecting me without respecting the product and it's about respecting you one million bucks if if that's gonna hurt you just say i'm out look one million bucks wouldn't even hurt me yeah but look that's not how the market works of course wait wait wait wait wait one million bucks wouldn't hurt you correct,,
13140,Valuation,can i ask you how you get into a 2 million evaluation?,,
13143,Valuation,so you're valuing your business at $5 million?,,
13144,Valuation,can i just ask what he invested to get that ten percent?,,
13146,Valuation,"so $400,000 for 5% that's the value proposition yes a big valuation y i mean if you're asking $8 million valuation you must be earning plenty of revenue and profit",,
13147,Valuation,so why are you worth 30 times this year's numbers,,
13150,Valuation,why is this worth four million bucks that's a great question?,,
13151,Valuation,what are you nuts no i'm not nutsyou're missing,,
13152,Valuation,what makes you think it's worth 10 million dollars,,
13154,Valuation,what do you think it should be?,,
13155,Valuation,why is it worth 1.5 million right?,,
13156,Valuation,the valuation is pretty high it's uh 1.5 million dollars why do you feel it's worth that much so?,,
13157,Valuation,you're looking for 250 000 for 10 so you're valuing your company at a cool two and a half mil correct why don't you demonstrate it,,
13159,Valuation,are you serious,,
13160,Valuation,what are you thinking i i'm thinking less money,,
13162,Valuation,so um the bit i'm confused about is amillion dollar valuationwe haven't got sales yet we don't have abarrier to entry really we're amarketing machine yeah yeah how did youcome up with that number,,
13164,Valuation,what's the land worth,,
13165,Valuation,"i want to talk about thebusiness i did a quickcalculation 250,000 for 7 half per. thatcomes to valuation of 3,333,000 33 333 yeah okay so what need to do is findout why",,
13166,Valuation,"how come these three investorsput in 50,000 and now suddenly we haveto buy in at a later stage at 250,000",,
13169,Valuation,but you you've just bailed your business at a million quid approached a million pounds yep on what basis,,
13170,Valuation,why is this business worth $2.5 million,,
13172,Valuation,so you're looking for 300000 for 10 so you're valuing your business at 3 million yes correct it's not a bad valuation for a brand new business but your sales are impressive so it seems to me you've almost started a community in the coconut bowls happens to simply be the product around that community is that how you see it,,
13175,Valuation,what was your last capital raising done at?,,
13176,Valuation,take the total value of every bottle of whiskey that you've got on your website about half a million what would it all come to in value?,,
13179,Valuation,okay without those deals what do you have is a isa perfectly nice product quite like it but but plenty of those things around on the market at the moment there are so what we're looking at is a business that currently turns over 90000 pounds a year and you projected the next year 2.1 million sales but largely on the back of these documents which are at best flimsy what i feel is that howder is not going to become a big brand without something really special so i think you're really going to struggle and a hundred thousand pounds i don't think he's going to touch the sides although i would suggest your business isn't worth six or seven hundred thousand today so it's a big ask,,
13181,Valuation,let's just talk about numbers yeah yeah you've got a valuation of a half a million pounds so let's get these big numbers what are they ladies,,
13182,Valuation,why isthis business in your wildestimagination worth a million pounds,,
13183,Valuation,eleventhousand pound turnover in its secondyear is that worth a million poundsdirectly on what you're saying,,
13184,Valuation,what assetsyou've got that are worth a millionpounds,,
13186,Valuation,"so so let me ask you a question ifyou had to revalue the business where weare today what would you value t if ifyou came to me today i would probablyaround the i suppose 40,000 perhaps atthis stage 40,000 yeah at this stage sookay",,
13188,Valuation,so you're valuing your new business itat 2 million bucks,,
13190,Valuation,"that's 200,000 exactly 10% so you're valuing your business at a cool $2 million correct",,
13197,Valuation,i think there's 700 thousand dollar valuations making me sweat a lot make me an offer,,
13198,Valuation,what was your last valuation of the company at,,
13199,Valuation,"just confirming $300,000 for 20% of your company yes valuing your business at 1.5 million that's correct okay",,
13200,Valuation,so that's 60 000 for 25 but you've got to lose 15 pounds oh sorry no no so you've just got to be convinced that that's what it is,,
13201,Valuation,so you're looking 15 for a hundred thousand dollars so you're valuing it around 660 is that right,,
13203,Valuation,so just to clarify that you're seeking a hundred thousand dollars yes for twenty percent which values your business at half a million dollars yes,,
13205,Valuation,"you're looking for $250,000 for 10% so you're valuing your company at a cool 2 and 1/2 mil correct",,
13206,Valuation,let's assume this works you've got zero revenue so you haven't really testedyour system you've put a fewtransactions through and it looks likeit pays and the money arrives in theright place so we got to test thesoftware we got to support it then wegot to sell it both sides and both sidesof the marketplace have to grow togetherto ensure success cuz if you grow oneside and not other you'll quickly die soyou got all of that risk out there sohow do you then value your business at 2and a2 million with all thatrisk,,
13207,Valuation,you're after 23 timesprofit projected profit 20 three timesthe projected profit,,
13208,Valuation,you know $2.3million youdreaming,,
13209,Valuation,"you're valuing the businessat 300,000 or less cuz you got controlbut that's what it's worth that's allit's worth right now actually ingenuinely we're only talking let's putin perspective you're valuing it on bigplans but the reality is you're onestore that hasn't even had 12 monthsworth oftrade and the fact that's all you'vegot why i think that i'd like to do itwith you is cuz i think i got could workwithyou now you know why this is called the shark tank i know you may not think it but itis a very very generousdeal youto us it's it is about the person we'reworking with um more than more than somuch the money as wellum would you um and obviously that's alarge jump from from our initialconversation but saying thatum i think what what about if we we wentinto it together side by side and wewould have a a completely even split at50% we would still learn from you and beopen to what yousay um so i don't think that would be anissue with if you think one thing thatwe would want to go the opposite way butum i think we'd probably consider and bequite happy with a 50% 5050 sharedonebeautiful",,
13212,Valuation,so um the bit i'm confused used about as a million dollar valuation we haven't got sales yet we don't have a barrier to entry really we're a marketing machine yeah yeah how did you come up with that number,,
13214,Valuation,so that's 75 000 for 20 so you're valuing your company at about 3.75 correct?,,
13215,Valuation,so if you've outgrown your kitchen you could talk about some pretty healthynumbers then to support your 375000 evaluation what do you reckon?,,
13216,Valuation,but actuallyhis valuation made all the sense in the world to meso i'm also not going to adjust from 35,,
13218,Valuation,so you guys are going to revolutionizethe tea market and i don't know howyou're going to attract the dragon atone half percent so you're really reallygonna show me how a t startup businesscan be worth about five millionso explain to me the numbers you turnedover 620000,,
13219,Valuation,"300,000 5% p a 6 million value you got to be selling a ton of these right?",,
13220,Valuation,if you're asking $8 million valuation you must be earning plenty of revenue and profit,,
13223,Valuation,explain to me who's advised you on thisvaluation,,
13224,Valuation,how do you justify valuing the business at five hundred thousand,,
13225,Valuation,are you valuing your business at 30 times revenue?,,
13227,Valuation,but you're valuing the business at12 million dollars right?,,
13232,Valuation,"why would you give up 20% of your company for $600,000 when you're anticipating doing how much in sales this year",,
13233,Valuation,you stand by evaluation of 600 000pounds,,
13234,Valuation,what's your value and dresses you have in the business please,,
13235,Valuation,you are not worth 1.2 million you are so far from that right now i can't approach it even though i see the idea,,
13236,Valuation,"so why don't you tell me what you're selling cuz if i want toplay ball and get involved in this put chef wonderful behind it i got to writea check for 400,000 why would i do that",,

16132,Potential Risks,my question comesback to why why has nobody doneit,,
16133,Potential Risks,if someone came up and said hmm eyeball there can they just take it off because all burglars ring the doorbell first you know what though mark that's actually true burglars are not usually violent criminals they want to see if someone's home they want the opportunity to go into a house that's not that does not have people in it so it's actually true people do ring the doorbell,,
16134,Potential Risks,are there bigger solutions that can come in and kind of push this out the door this category will exist i mean the doorbell will stay there it doesn't get trumped by technology i'm going to drive that there's a thousand different ways to alert what business is not going to get replaced by future technology but they're here it's about being able to be nimble and actually be part of that change,,
16135,Potential Risks,what's been the largest obstacle you've had to overcome?,,
16136,Potential Risks,no really what's happening i'd love you to address that because that's my main point of concern,,
16137,Potential Risks,i have a couple of big concerns here number one is that you don't know if this is going to work right you've got an enormous amount of orders sitting there nobody has the product yet you don't know what the customer feedback is if people love it what your returns are going to be i mean that is a huge concern right now right the good news is you have their money first,,
16139,Potential Risks,what's your biggest obstacle?,,
16141,Potential Risks,wouldn't the u s part of your business counteract that,,

16150,Potential Risks,where do you think you wentwrong,,
16151,Potential Risks,couldn't i get it wrong if you're l that in the wrong place couldn't i cause myself more problem,,
16152,Potential Risks,you're trying to sell it without actually any level of proof that it works,,
16153,Potential Risks,another big concern eddie would be that um bird droppings,,
16155,Potential Risks,you tell me what the biggest risks to your business are,,
16159,Potential Risks,and this person or company that you'vedone it with are they likely to stay inbusiness for that ten years to be ableto pay you the money or have you done isreally over?,,

16170,Potential Risks,if you don't find one do you think theshow is going to be a little bit of adrag,,
16173,Potential Risks,but with your conventional sun visor down you can't see anything in that entire line of sight you're going to get some liability with this one i mean remember you're the sun is not only moving but so are you you're gonna have to make subtle adjustments to this on an ongoing basis that could be a distraction to the driver,,
16205,Potential Risks,i have a bit of an issue the fact that it is up against your skin you know from a hygiene point of view i will be a little bit uncomfortable to be honest using this in a hair salon.,,
16215,Potential Risks,if there was anything bad about these what would it be,,
16216,Potential Risks,i mean is that going to be a push back from consumers?,,
16217,Potential Risks,if someone's going to invest in this they've got to make hay for the next 3 years after that point someone can legally copy it?,,
16218,Potential Risks,give me an example of a risk that you've taken that you wouldworry about,,
16223,Potential Risks,what's to stop me coming on to your site and ordering a sign from my neighbor's house saying it's for sale and he doesn't know anything about us,,
16226,Potential Risks,so when you actually do do three million bucks in calendar year whatever and they go wow that's a great business guess what price has gone up 20 what happens then?,,
16227,Potential Risks,has that been a barrier,,
16232,Potential Risks,so the education department are going to make coding mandatory in schools digital technologies mendez playing coding is one aspect of shirley that's going to destroy your business modeling?,,
16233,Potential Risks,your biggest issue is that if you for example allow a bad review to go up on a site that is counter-intuitive because if i owned that surgery and i was then not getting any referrals because of your one review that you've allowed to be posted on your website that means one thing an immediate cessation of your income,,
16236,Potential Risks,but a good agood pole dancer doesn't make a good business person or a good pole dancerdoesn't make a good franchisee so yougot to kind of get the combinationthat's why the the pool gets smaller and smaller andsmaller,,
16237,Potential Risks,what would stop you getting that,,
16239,Potential Risks,so the education department are going tomake coding mandatory in schools uhdigital technologies mandatory andcoding is one aspect so surely that'sgoing to destroy your business modelthen?,,
16240,Potential Risks,can i have a quick look at something if amischievous child got stuck on insidethis we'll open it?,,

16249,Potential Risks,how is covet affected your business has gone up or down certain markets were down other markets i'm happy to report were up,,
16250,Potential Risks,what happens if of the 35 growers some of them see the opportunity here and they decide to put their market price up,,
16251,Potential Risks,what happens if you folded up your tent and stop doing it right now could youcould you pay down the debt could youwould you have to declare bankruptcy howhow are you going to manage thislike are you going to be able to dealwith it,,
16252,Potential Risks,you are tied to a manufacturer because he owns the ip if he wants to double the price of the product because you've become really successful and you've done a great job then you can't take that product away from him and give it to another manufacturer to create correct,,
16253,Potential Risks,what's the problem why has it gone sobadly,,
16257,Potential Risks,i think we've seen over the last numberof yearsthe difficulties in bringing change tothe education system in this country it appears to benotoriously slow so changing thecurriculumhow easy will it be to get thedepartment of education and subsequentlythethe teachers themselves and theprincipals toaccept this as a valid part of of whatthey're doing along with all of theother things they have to do because weknow how busy they are,,
16258,Potential Risks,and what security are you going to give the small investors on that loan?,,
16259,Potential Risks,is that you're the second person so you're the highest risk so if that building falls down or they go broke the banks come in and go where the first mortgage we get all the security and then you've basically got nothing so that's why you get a better return on that because it's higher risk and i don't doubt that the investment is a higher risk and that's why you get a higher interest rate no 40 percent is not a higher interest rate?,,
16260,Potential Risks,honey the obvious question is around safetyyup it's a slippery environment yeahbabies are fragile that's right yes i'msure you've done extensive testingbecause this is such acritical factor for all parentsobviously what have you done to ensurethat there's norisk that the chair could topple over orthe mechanism could break,,
16261,Potential Risks,how do you think you can overcome what's going to be a natural resistance that people don't like the thought of eating bugs,,
16262,Potential Risks,if you don't find one do you think theshow is going to be a little bit of adrag?,,
16267,Potential Risks,doesn't straw burn normally,,
16268,Potential Risks,what's the landscape before i invest in something that's so at the beginning stages,,
16270,Potential Risks,what would stop you getting that?,,
16271,Potential Risks,the question is how confident can you be about this this business that you've got that you've got coming up lots of things can go wrong with supplying and that can all go horribly wrong it could but the product has been now tested for two years packaging has been tested the supply channel is well established shadow yeah and this and this deal is going to happen,,
16272,Potential Risks,do you not think it's a bit of a risk that you're heavily relying on retailers you don't have a direct consumer business,,
16273,Potential Risks,but what would happen if something went wrong and it blew up is the insurance company going to turnaround and say sorry you've fitted something to a piece of equipment that didn't have any safety standards do you see where i'm going with it,,
16274,Potential Risks,so at the end of the fourth year we'regoing to be 24 million and that isconservative and i know it sounds crazyand you're going to laugh at that butgenuinely like i really have no interestin being crazy so that is based onmultiples based on where the business isnow you said you're not here to be crazyso you tell me what the biggest risks toyour business are,,
16275,Potential Risks,that's your biggest challenge,,
16276,Potential Risks,isn't there kind of a riskof giving people a false sense ofsecuritysometimes in other words if you take ablood test for ovarian cancer or it's apsa test for prostateyou know you get the numbers the numberslooks good but quite often that's notenough in itself to make a diagnosisand you know going to the doctor andhaving the resultsin combination with uh physicalexaminationis what really gives you the fullpicture yesand is there not a concern that thepatient gets that says okay my psanumbers are goodand doesn't bother going to the gp,,
16278,Potential Risks,tell me how many people are going to feel okay about putting their laptop or their i pad or whatever their phone into this refrigerator and just leaving it there,,
16279,Potential Risks,so can you break that agreement if need be so if he starts supplying bad bad produce what happens,,
16280,Potential Risks,have you given that some thought with regard to you know never do business with her family they say yeah it it certainly has it's a double double-edgedsword so um look i think there's there's always ways to to handle that,,
16281,Potential Risks,what if for some strange reason your two beautiful wives decided that they wanted to upgrade and all of a sudden you two guys are no longer the sons-in-law you're the ex-s sonin-law um you've got a lot of eggs in a very important basket there and there's definitely a risk involved there so for that reason only i'mout,,
16282,Potential Risks,tell me about your challenges you had when creating this where do we start?,,

16562,Investment & Deal Terms,so i was considering making an offer so what we're looking at is one hundred thousand dollars for thirty five percent plus a seven percent royalty until one hundred and ten thousand dollars is paid back okay and then the royalty would disappear so in other words he wants 10 on his money he's up to 110 percent of the repayment and i'm still left with the 35 equity offer to pay back you understand that of course oh yes yeah so you're getting your equity for free what sort of a deal is that if you accept that i'll match that deal,,
16563,Investment & Deal Terms,"that's $50,000 for 25% that you've got to lose 15 pounds oh sorry so you're just gonna be convinced it does on point for the demographic on you know you're in great shape and you're just gonna tight legs you're done you want to tighten up shape up if you're thinking about i'm thinking about that okay all of you the 50,000 bucks i'm after $1 persub per week until a hundred thousand bucks is repaid there will be an interest rate if we don't hit some milestones and we're going for a thousand and twelve months get interest rate of some description will kick in if you don't hit that because we've got to keep you honest all right otherwise you get out of fifty thousand bucks be lazyand do nothing so every single subscriber that you have and then you give a dollar to him to repay the$50,000 right until it gets to a hundred thousand dollars and dollars okay he basically wants to double his money then i'm out right and i have any equity i don't own a single cent of your business",,
16564,Investment & Deal Terms,you got a very interesting dilemma because one is offering you money but keeping your business whole the other is offering you money and expertise what do you think you really need,,
16565,Exit Strategy,if you and alison were to get your money back would you consider dropping it because 20 is quite a a big chunk for me to get it this far on my own to give what's going to be our most successful year to give 20 of that away how would we get it back like you'd buy us you'd buy back some of the shares from us is that what you're thinking or something along the lines yeah can we have a little consultation,,
16566,Exit Strategy,how do i get out before i get in's the exit here,,
16568,Exit Strategy,what's the exit,,

16583,Exit Strategy,if you if you really take off someone comes to you just to buy the brand are you okay with that?,,
16585,Exit Strategy,if this really is as proprietary as i think it is there are two very large luggage manufacturers right why not just take that and ship two of them one to each because and then have it have a bidding war for your pet,,
16586,Exit Strategy,what is your exit strategy for this business,,
16592,Exit Strategy,so if one of the big manufacturers comes along and says time to hand it over so we can take it worldwide who is a natural fit for this product?,,

16599,Exit Strategy,two three years down the line wheneverit may be would there be an opportunityto buy back some of thepercentage i tell you why this is a nois because you go on ajourney building the success of thebusiness only to give back the that it'sa bitcounterintuitive valid pointokay so for thatreason we're in we're inwa i thought you were going to say forthat reason i'mout well done d av we're looking forwardto working with you thank you thank youcheers,,

16612,Exit Strategy,would you be willing to possibly go in with lori offering money is never an insulting never an insult never never be insulted by money all right so i'm just letting you know the reason why i would give you this offer is because surely i would be taking you someplace to license this you do not want to do this business yourself you really don't and that's where we see it for us we're looking for that you know the shark to partner with to get that exit strategy it would be two hundred thousand for one-third of the company,,
